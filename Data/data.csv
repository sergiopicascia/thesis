1,George Michael,I Want Your Sex,happy,"[From a PSA recorded for MTV before its music video aired]
In the past there were arguments for and against casual sex. Then it became a question of morality. These days it can be a question of life or death. It's as simple as that. And this song is not about casual sex

[Part 1]

[Verse 1]
There’s things that you guess
And a'things a'that you know
There’s boys you can trust
And a'girls that you don’t
There’s little things you hide
And little things that you show
Sometimes you think you’re gonna get it
But you don’t and that’s just the way it goes

[Pre - Chorus]
I swear I won’t tease you
Won’t tell you no lies (Yeah)
Don’t need no Bible
Just look in my eyes
I’ve a'waited so long baby
Now that we’re friends
Every man’s got his patience
And here’s where mine ends

[Chorus]
I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your...sex
[Verse 2]
It’s playin' on my mind
It’s dancin' on my soul
It’s taken so much time
So why don’t you just let me go
I’d really like to try
Oh, I’d really love to know
When you tell me you’re gonna regret it
Then I tell you that I love you but you still say no

[Pre - Chorus]
I swear I won’t tease you
Won’t tell you no lies (Yeah)
Don’t need no Bible
Just look in my eyes (Oooh)
I’ve waited so long baby
Out in the cold
I can’t take much more girl
I’m losing control

[Chorus]
I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your…sex (sex! ow!)
[Bridge]
It’s natural, it’s chemical (let’s do it)
It’s logical habitual (can we do it?)
It’s sensual but most of all
Sex is something that we should do
Sex is something for me and you
Sex is natural, sex is good
Not everybody does it
But everybody should
Sex is natural, sex is fun
Sex is best when it’s one on one
One on one

[Break]
Hoo ah (sex) I’m not your father
Hoo ah (sex) I’m not your brother
Hoo ah (sex) talk to your sister
Hoo ah (sex) I am a lover
Hoo ah (sex) Wooooo-ooooohh!!
Hoo ah (sex)
Hoo ah (sex) Ow!
C-c-c-c-c-c-come on (Hoo ah)

[Outro]
What’s your definition of dirty baby?
What do you consider pornography?
Don’t you know I love it till it hurts me baby?
Don’t you think it’s time you had sex with me?
What’s your definition of dirty baby?
What do you call pornography?
Don’t you know I love it till it hurts me baby?
Don’t you think it’s time you had sex with me?
Ow! Sex with me
Ow! Sex with me
Mmmm have sex with me (Hoo ah)
C-c-c-c-c-c-come on

*************************
[Part 2]

Oh so much love, that you’ve never seen
Let’s make love, put your trust in me (hmm)
Don’t you listen to what they told you
Because I love you, let me hold you

Oh, I’m not your brother
I’m not your father
Oh will you ever change your mind?
I’m a gentle lover with a heart of gold
But baby you've been so unkind...oh

Come on
I want your sex
Come on, I want your sex
That’s right, all night
Oh, I want your sex
I want your…sex

Sexy baby’s (Sexy baby’s)
Sexy body (Sexy body)
Keeps me guessing (Keeps me guessing)
With a promise (Oh)
I know we can come together
But the question is Will we ever ever?

Sexy baby’s (Sexy baby’s)

3,Katatonia,12,sad,"[Chorus]
Black theatre of love
Violet dancers cast their blood
The moon gave me flowers
For funerals to come

[Verse 1]
12 shapes bow before her
I am still one of them
12 morbid ways to die
Her beauty scares me

[Verse 2]
I'm falling deeper
No more pain to feel now
Touch the silence
Afraid of hell

[Chorus]
Black theatre of love
Violet dancers drink my blood
The moon gave me flowers
For funerals to come

[Outro]
I cannot breathe
I am losing life
The moon paints the skyline blue
She died so beautifulEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",metal
4,Bing Crosby,Swinging On A Star,happy,"[Chorus: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are (Ooo)
Or would you rather be a mule?

[Verse 1: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
A mule is an animal with long funny ears
He kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

[Chorus: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are, doo doo
Or would you rather be a pig?

[Verse 2: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He has no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig
[Chorus: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish?

[Verse 3: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

A new kind of jumped up slippery fish

[Outro: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo
Everyday you'll meet quite a few
So you see it's all up to you (Ooo)
You can be better than you are (Ooo)
You could be swingin' on a star

Next Thursday you're invited to watch Rising Tide's live coverage of a gala tribute in salute to Ronald Reagan. Host Haley Barbour joins special guest Lady Margaret Thatcher in celebrating the former president's 83rd birthday. Tickets are 1000 Dollars a plate but you can see the event free on GOP TV.

[Verse 1]
Images of perfection, suntan and napalm
Grenada, Haiti, Poland, Nicaragua
Who shall we choose for our morality
I'm thinking right now of Hollywood tragedy
Big Mac, smack, Phoenix, R., please smile y'all
Cuba, Mexico can't cauterise our discipline
Your idols speak so much of the abyss
Yet your morals only run as deep as the surface
[Chorus]
Cool, groovy, morning, fine
Tipper Gore was a friend of mine
I love a free country
The stars and stripes and an apple for mommy

[Bridge]
(Conservatives say) ""There ain't no black in the Union Jack""
(Democrats say) ""There ain't enough white in the Stars and Stripes""

[Verse 2]
Compton, Harlem, a pimp fucked a priest
The white man has just found a new moral saviour
Vital stats, how white was their skin
Unimportant, just another inner-city drive-by thing
Morning, fine, serve your first coffee of the day
Real privilege, it will take your problems away
Number one, the best, no excuse from me
I am here to serve the Moral Majority
[Chorus]
Cool, groovy, morning, fine
Tipper Gore was a friend of mine
I love a free country
The stars and stripes and an apple for mommy

Zapruder the first to masturbate
The world's first taste of crucified grace

His body fuels the power fire and the flames rise to the sky

With mud and straw - blood and sweat

Hands are full of fishin' rods
And the tackle on our backs
We just stood there gettin' wet
With our backs against the fence

Oh, the water
Hope it don't rain all day

Stoned me just like going home

And the sun came up
And we were gettin' dry
Almost let a pick-up truck
Nearly pass us by
So we jumped right in
And the driver grinned
And he dropped us up the road
And we looked at the swim
And we jumped right in
Not to mention fishing poles

There were bottles too
One for me and you
And he said ""Hey! There you are""

I'm on my way to what I want from this world
And years from now you'll make it to the next world
And everything that you receive up yonder
Is what you gave to me the day I wandered

I took a right, I took a right turning yesterday
Ah-hah (ah-hah) ah-hah (ah-hah), yeah
I took a right, I took a right turning yesterday
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I took the road that brought me to your home town
I took the bus to streets that I could walk down
I walked the streets to find the one I'd looked for
I climbed the stair that led me to your front door

And now that I don't want for anything
I'd have Al Jolson sing I'm sitting on top of the world

I'll do my best, I'll do my best to do the best I can
Ah-hah (ah-hah) ah-hah (ah-hah), yeah
I'll do my best, I'll do my best to do the best I can
Ha-ah ha-ah ha-ah ha-ah
To keep my feet from jumping from the   ground, dear
To keep my heart from jumping through my mouth, dear
To keep the past, the past and not the present
To try and learn when you teach me a lesson

And now that I don't want for anything
I'd have Al Jolson sing I'm sitting on top of the world

I'm on my way from misery to happiness today
Ah-hah (ah-hah) ah-hah (ah-hah)
I'm on my way from misery to happiness today
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I'm on my way to what I want from this world
And years from now you'll make it to the next world
And everything that you receive up yonder
Is what you gave to me the day I wandered

I'm on my way to what I want from this world

16,50 Cent,My Gun Go Off,angry,"[Produced by Adam Deitch & Eric Krasno]

[Hook]
Nigga, my gun go off - you see the barrel turning
You feel the hollows burning, nigga, now you're learning
Nigga, my gun go off - call it attempted murder
Nigga, I'm trying to murk you when I come back busting
Nigga, my gun go off - don't try to say I'm tripping
When I get to flipping and I smack the clip in
Nigga, my gun go off - we call it putting work in
Leaving niggas hurting, homicide's lurking
Nigga, my gun go off

[Verse 1]
Fuckboy, you can see it to believe it
Try to dodge and weave it, end up a paraplegic
Believe me, its easy, I'll hurt you, I'll murk you
I'll pop something, drop something, I ain't going to stop hunting
Run, run, 'til you're spun, one shot, one gun
One 911 emergency, it's murder, B
It's excellent execution when I'm pulling the trigger
No mistake for that cake, I'm hitting you and your niggas
Feel the flame when I aim for the top of your brain
See the spark and the bang, nigga, shit ain't a game
Do the math or get blast, bullets go through the glass
Goes through your ass fast and the leather seat in your Nav
Nigga, its not a war when there's casualties on one side, I ride
Turn it up on you nigga after Jake ride by
I click-clack, that's that, I don't flash, I mash
I wave the Uzi at them, I make a movie out them

Nigga, my gun go off - you see the barrel turning

Leaving niggas hurting, homicide's lurking
Nigga, my gun go off

[Verse 2]
You better lose yourself in the moment
Use it, fuck the music, I'mma let it go
You only get one shot before I back out and fire back
At your hat, your back, your ass crack, your nutsack
Your Cadillac, if you make it to that, I'm hitting that
The 70's was smack, the 80's crack
The 90's was grimy, millennium MACs, man
Clips on the whips I ride in them, bad bitches, I ride in them
Don't worry, I'll get them, gat's jammed or unjammed
God damn safest the safety don't work, squeeze the eagle, it chirps
End up faced down in the dirt more than hurt
Bring the beef where you hang out, bang out, shots ring out
Hit your shoulders trying to blow your brains out
Hit your homies in their legs, bet they have their canes out tomorrow
You know tomorrow's just a day away
If you can keep your heart beating, then your ass awake

18,Avenged Sevenfold,Coming Home,angry,"[Verse 1]
I've been away, searching for a reason
Another purpose to find
I've sailed the seas, fought my many demons
I've looked to gods in the skies
I've stood in hell, where many had to suffer
I stared the devil in the eyes
Walked many roads to witness ancient idols
And found the great gates of fire

[Verse 2]
Had many storms, question my conviction
Gave armies reason to rise
The hangman's searching, for bones he can borrow
While I escaped in the night, fight or flight

[Chorus]
Live again, all roads end
I'll be coming home
Tend your light, 'cause on this night
I'll be coming home

[Verse 3]
Escaped the hail of calculated mortars
Then drank the blood of a king
The desert rain has washed away direction
Had angels looking after me
So it seems
[Chorus]
Live again, all roads end
I'll be coming home
Tend your light, 'cause on this night
I'll be coming home

[Verse 4]
My story ends, not far from where it started
My weary limbs have grown old
I've seen the world through the eyes of a nomad
Home is where the heart is I've been told
So I go

[Chorus]
Live again, all roads end
I'll be coming home
Tend your light, 'cause on this night
I'll be coming home

[Outro]
I'm coming home

I'm not afraid of anything
I just need to know that I can breathe
I don't need much of anything
But suddenly, suddenly
I am small and the world is big
All around me is fast moving
Surrounded by so many things
Suddenly, suddenly

How does it feel to be
Different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel to be
Different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel?

But I get tired and I get weak
I get lost and I can't sleep (I can't sleep)

20,The Streets,Never Went to Church,sad,"[Intro: Mike Skinner]
Two great European narcotics, alcohol and Christianity
I know which one I prefer

[Chorus: Mike Skinner, Laura Vane & The Wayne Hart Singers]
We never went to church
Just get on with work and sometimes things'll hurt
But it's hit me since you left us
And it's so hard not to search
If you were still about
I'd ask you what I'm supposed to do now
I just get a bit scared every now
I hope I made you proud

[Verse 1: Mike Skinner]
On your birthday when mum passed the forks and spoons
I put my head on the table, I was so distraught with you
You tidied your things into the bin the more poorly you grew
So there's nothing of yours to hold or to talk to
You put your hand up and interrupt the conversation with a ""But""
People say I interrupt people with the same look
Sometimes I think so hard, I can't remember how your face looked
Started reading about dreams in your favourite book
I panic and pace when I can't see the right thing to do
You'd be scratching your head through the best advice you knew
And I feel sad I can't hear you reciting it through
I miss you, Dad, but I've got nothing to remind me of you
[Chorus: Mike Skinner, Laura Vane & The Wayne Hart Singers]
We never went to church
Just get on with work and sometimes things'll hurt
But it's hit me since you left us
And it's so hard not to search
If you were still about
I'd ask you what I'm supposed to do now
I just get a bit scared every now
I hope I made you proud

[Verse 2: Mike Skinner]
I needed a break when your book about dreams was taken
I needed to pray or see a priest that day
I needed to leave this trade and just heave it away
But I cleaned up my place like you so I could see things straight
I never cared about God when life was sailin' on the calm
So I said I'd get my head down
And I'd deal with the ache in my heart
And, for that, if God exists, I'd reckon he'd pay me regard
Mum says me and you are the same from the start
I guess, then, you did leave me something to remind me of you
Every time I interrupt someone like you used to
When I do something like you, you'll be on my mind all through
'Cause I forgot you left me behind to remind me of you

[Chorus: Mike Skinner, Laura Vane & The Wayne Hart Singers]
We never went to church
Just get on with work and sometimes things'll hurt
But it's hit me since you left us
And it's so hard not to search
If you were still about
I'd ask you what I'm supposed to do now
I just get a bit scared every now
I hope I made you proud
We never went to church
Just get on with work and sometimes things'll hurt
But it's hit me since you left us
And it's so hard not to search
But you, you still tell me how you didn't know
What to do, even now
And then I'm not so scared somehow
'Cause I know that you'd be proud
[Outro: Mike Skinner]
I got a good one for you, Dad
I'm gonna see a priest, a Rabbi and a Protestant clergyman
You always said I should hedge my bets1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",hip hop
21,Geto Boys,Chuckie,angry,"[Verse 1: Bushwick Bill]
I told you size wasn't shit, that's why I murdered your nieces
Wasn't my fault they found they head cut in 88 pieces
Don't let 'em run, hurry up and catch 'em
You grab an arm, I grab an arm let's pull 'till we stretch 'em
Play pussy, get fucked means you're better off dead
I wanted seafood so I fished in a child’s head
Motherfuckers beware cause I'm sick
Dead heads and frog legs, mmm... cake mix!
Friday the 13th the night of the living dead
Vampire arms walkin' 'round givin niggas head
If you didn't die, I would say you got lucky
All bodies found dead, fuck it, blame it on Chuckie
But this is child's play... motherfucka!!!

[Verse 2: Bushwick Bill]
Aw, fuck, Chuck's on a killin' spree
Gimme some barb and I'll start by killin me
When I murder, I tried to slack off
Now 100 missiles blew a little girl's back off
My name is Chuckie, some say I'm insane
You give me some gin, and I might eat a dog's brain
Give me a motherfuckin 15-pack
And I'll be damned if I don't bring 15 dead niggas back
A murder contest, you know I'll win it
Cause in every mailbox, there be a head with a knife in it
I'm gettin' hungry, I need to be fed
I feel like eatin' a bag of barbequed broke legs
Bustin' necks with a motherf*ckin' brick!
Half my body is Chuckie, the other half is Bushwick
A short nigga always pumpin' some lead
I haven't figured out a way to get my fist out your forehead
What up? Get up, sit up, you get lit up
A knife in his neck made a polar bear spit up
A 9, a Uzi is my only utensil
Inside his chest they found 10,000 pencils
You have the nerve to go against Chuck?
With fifty guns aimed at you, how the fuck you gonna duck, yo?
When I'm mad, I'm ready to slay
The graveyards are packed but it ain't nothin' but child's play
[Verse 3: Bushwick Bill]
You'd better murder me, put me to rest
Cause if you don't I'll come out shootin' with my head in a bird's chest
Pissed off, the way I'm always soundin'
Killed a punk in '82, and they just now found 'im
Some say I'm crazy, some say I'm on crack
Before I die cut off my leg and let me die in Iraq
A born loser, some say I'm mindless
If I get pissed off, you leave naked and spineless
Worse than Charles Manson, never havin' a equal
Went sleepwalking last night and killed 300 people
When I woke up they had me chained to the floor
When they told me what I did I killed 300 more, yo
You wanna rumble? Then go get your war hat
I went to jail for assault with a carjack
I might be small but my nuts are big
The worst thing that you could do is let me keep your fuckin' kids
Cause I'ma teach 'em how to act
And if they ain't actin' right, they dyin' tonight
So, uh, ain't no use in you tryin' to spot 'em
I send you a motherfuckin' note that says ""Chuckie's got em!""EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",hip hop

23,Demon Hunter,The Tide Began To Rise,sad,"[Verse 1]
I don't belong here
I never saw this on the path I walk
The blood-stained walls, the lines of chalk on the floor
It's getting so hard
I never saw the backlash when the tide began to rise
I can't remember
The way it was when everything felt right
My mouth held shut and eyes sealed tight with control

[Chorus]
So I remember on the inside
(I found) A dark infernal place I don't want to face any more
(Somehow) I won't stop feeding the pain, my heart's just the same as before
(I found) A dark infernal place I don't want to face any more
And somehow...

[Verse 2]
So now I'm stuck here
Between the guilty and the insincere
The words I've spoke have left me here all alone
I should have known this
I never saw the backlash when the tide began to rise
I wish it all gone
I could have burned it when I had that choice
Now I'd die to kill this noise in my head
[Chorus]
So I remember on the inside
(I found) A dark infernal place I don't want to face any more
(Somehow) I won't stop feeding the pain, my heart's just the same as before
(I found) A dark infernal place I don't want to face any more
And somehow...

24,Lily Holbrook,Better Left Unsaid,sad,"You can cut my heart in sections
And I'll show you no objection
Cause it's better than being alone
It's better than being alone
And there's a strange elation
In your subtle assassination
I thought I saw a glimmer of hope
I thought I saw a glimmer of hope

But I don't think that you could ever understand

I could stay here in the middle
And speak to you in riddles
But I'd rather just feel the burn
I'd rather feel the burn
So you can strike me with your matches
And scatter me like ashes
Your little angel playing in your dirt
But I don't think that you could ever understand

I don't think that you could ever understand
(And the rain keeps falling down)
I don't think that you could ever understand

I don't think that you could ever understand

Some things I keep to myself
Some things are better left unsaid
And sometimes I feel like this could break me in half
Still some things I'll never, ever tell

I don't think that you could ever understand

My constitution keeps changing till it slips away

Should I sleep or stay awake?
Am I really happy or is it all

Hiding thoughts, just hoping one day I'll get out

Breaking trance so silent, so I can stay the same

Should I sleep or stay awake?
Am I really happy or is it all
Just an illusion?

Let me feel
I need to know what you keep inside
No need to speak
Just let it be
Carry out this wish for me let nothing interfere
Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil
Discard your clothes
Let loose you hair
We're intertwined forever and have always been
Say the word
And I'll depart
Upon your lips dwells nothing but the meaning of my cause

Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil

And so comes the dark
Vibrant as ever before
Flowers already withered
In this endless winter of souls
Outside in the park
The days move along
And nothing ever changes
They have nothing on us
And we've always knew
That nothing ever changes
Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil
This is ours alone
Feeding off the warmth
Lured out from inside

Depending on the life blood

Rise to submission

This is ours alone

Lured out from inside

Move in me and set me free

Remove all the wheel blocks

Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Got to get airborne before it's too late

Ascending and turning our Spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns

Moving through the dark

That's hangin' up on someone else's wall?

It's heavy on my mind

And I'm dreamin' again
Like I've always been
Way down low
I still know

That the prettiest thing I ever did see
Was dusty as the handle on the door
Rusty as a nail stuck in the old pine floor
It looks like home to me

And suddenly i'm trembling and I don't know why
There's something deep about you
That echoes in my mind

Mystifying feelings
Running round in my brain
Love is all around me
And it's written in your name
Love is all around me
And it's written in your name

The wind stands still around you
And in your eyes the light inside you shines
If souls collide in heaven
Why not in present time ?

Words just can't convey it
Silence means no need to explain
Love is all around me
And it's written in your name
Love is all around me
And it's written in your name

I am overcome
What a strange thing you have done
From now on my life has change
Nothing now can be the same
Love is all around me
Love is all around me
And it's written in your name

33,Nickleback,Rockstar,angry,"[Verse 1]
I’m through with standing in line to clubs I’ll never get in
It’s like the bottom of the ninth and I’m never gonna win
This life hasn’t turned out quite the way I want it to be
(Tell me what you want)
I want a brand new house on an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me
(Ah, so what you need?)
I’ll need a, a credit card that’s got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty-seven thousand feet
(Been there, done that)
I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me
(So how you gonna do it?)
I’m gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I’d even cut my hair and change my name

[Chorus]
'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We’ll all stay skinny 'cause we just won’t eat
And we’ll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger’s gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair, and we'll
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar, oh
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
[Verse 2]
I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight bodyguards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs so I can eat my meals for free
(I’ll have the quesadilla, ha-ha)
I’m gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to blow my money for me
(So how you gonna do it?)
I’m gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I’d even cut my hair and change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars

With the latest dictionary of today’s who’s who
They’ll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody’s got a drug dealer on speed dial, well
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
[Verse 3]
I’m gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills from a Pez dispenser
Get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sync 'em every night so I don’t get 'em wrong

Myth or legend
Nymph tale washed ashore
Near the kraken sleepeth stirs coral and bone
Infinite city
No sexy sneer
Hideous creation
Human and animal
Banter songs of rudeness to be adhered
Not on rocks that glisten
Harps to listen
Comb hair
Tear right to pieces
Left to recess a watery grave

Sensing the blood of prey
Swimming in fear for life

Then I got up to write you a song
I watched ya sleep and I fell in love
Ya must've been sent from heaven above
Don't think you could never do no wrong

Then you farted....
Oh girl you farted..

First I thought that it was kinda cute
I suppressed a smile when I heard your girly poot
Then came the smell came whoftin by
And brought a little tear drop to my eye
I think that I'll go sleep out on the couch

'Cause you farted...

You could make milk curdle
Make your skin crawl
Make the paint peal off of the wall
I won't sleep under the covers no more
Since the hot winds blew from out your back door

Baby, it sure has been a gas
But I can't live life in fear of your ass
So I gathered up my clothes and old dog bill
Moved back to my house at the top of the hill
Well old boy I guess its just you and me

Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong, but we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart

I see the children in the rain like the parade before the pain
I see the love, I see the hate, I see this world that we can make
I see the life, I see the sky, I'd give it all to see you fly
Yes, we wave this flag of hatred, but you're the ones who made it
I watch the beauty of all our lives, passing right before my eyes
I hear the hate in all your words, all the words to make us hurt
We get so sick, we're so sick, we never wanted all this
Medication for the kids with no reason to live

So we march to the drums of the damned as we come
Watch it burn in the sun, we are numb

As we walk among these shadows in these streets, these fields of battle
Take it up, we wear the mantle, raise your hands with burning candles
Hear us whisper in the dark; in the rain, you see the spark
Feel the beating of our hearts, fleeting hope as we depart
All together, walk alone against all we've ever known
All we've ever really wanted was a place to call our home
But you take all we are, the innocence of our hearts
Made to kneel before the altar as you tear us apart

Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)

Ahem, back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand?
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?
Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
""Shady, man, no, don't massacre the fans!""
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him, just ‘cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it, then squish it, then pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes, he can-can; don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a 2; you're practically a 10
I know you want me, girl, in fact, I see you grin
Now come in, girl

Well, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner, then
Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut off the middleman
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in
Love with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man, I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch

Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis

Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!""
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter of fact, bake me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak
Baby, I think you just met your soulmate
Now break it down, girl

It is sad to think that sooner or

And you may have thought it tragic

But don't you worry

No more ashes, no more sackcloth
And an arm band made of black cloth
Will some day nevermore adorn a sleeve
For if the bomb that drops on you
Gets your friends and neighbors too
There'll be nobody left behind to grieve

And we will all go together when we go
What a comforting fact that is to know
Universal bereavement -
An inspiring achievement!
Yes, we all will go together when we go

We will all go together when we go
All suffused with an incandescent glow
No one will have the endurance
To collect on his insurance
Lloyd's of London will be loaded when they go
Oh we will all fry together when we fry
We'll be French-fried potatoes by-and-by
There will be no more misery
When the world is our rotisserie
Yes, we all will fry together when we fry
Down by the old maelstrom
There'll be a storm before the calm

And we will all bake together when we bake
There'll be nobody present at the wake
With complete participation
In that grand incineration
Nearly three billion hunks of well-done steak

Oh we will all char together when we char
And let there be no moaning of the bar
Just sing out a Te Deum
When you see that ICBM
And the party will be come-as-you-are

Oh, we will all burn together when we burn
There'll be no need to stand and wait your turn
When it's time for the fallout
And Saint Peter calls us all out
We'll just drop our agendas and adjourn
You will all go directly to your respective Valhallas
Go directly, do not pass 'GO', do not collect two hundred dollars

And we will all go together when we go

For those who choose to mouth the curse
A tragic serenade
With Judas in my stride
The Gothic halls of shame
Where statues coldly hold no worse
Than the murders I reclaim
From a dark, forsaken time

Kissing heaven, spent
He wipes lips free of his hectic discharge
Wishing to repent
For the brute that ravaged free
In slight hands beauty weeps
Conquest's deep methodical screwing
Hurt repeatedly
Like the world wound at his feet

Dirge Inferno

As it is written, damn it
So let it be wrung
From throats of those in overthrow
The past at last has come

A savage bit without respite
Pervades the freezing air
This winter chill, grist for his mill
If tears of joy will blear elsewhere
And church bells drown in the cracks of doom
The storms above us hew
As lightning runs like bifurcate tongues
Deflowering two by two
Hissing, malcontent
He storms the skies on electric discharge
Pissing in contempt
On the effigies of the weak
Killing all resolve
The great beast simmers, his scarlet women
Spit their vitriol
On the terrified face of peace

Dirge Inferno

As it is written, damn it
So let it be wrung
From throats of those in overthrow
Our past at last has come

A hellbound heart, the rose and thorn
Have locked to hasten blood
The moon disrobes, to harden droves
Of legions pouring
These rivers press, his breath adorns
Senates and enemy seats
Whilst his power takes as ingratitude
The writhing of the weak

""Wormwood my name
The poisoned star that fell to earth
And blistered free of shame
In the pits of self-rebirth
Now those caves become a farret
Overseeing endless barracks
As the waters turn to claret
And the Vatican satins burn1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",metal

No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep, my friend, and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says ""rage""?

It's time to be born again
Don't talk about sex that's a sin
Confess your evils to the man
He'll do everything he can
Don't go mass you'll go to hell
We'll all be there it'll be swell

Pulling your lives
With such lies
Weak don't survive

Into the vacuum culture

Snatch that bottle off the shelve

Holy water only makes me bleed
Touch that cross to my head
It may burn but I won't be dead
To burn your rosaries
To burn it all
Death to us all

It is time to concentrate the mindless sheep
Don't be late, you'll be slammed, you'll be mauled
You'll be thrown into the walls
Everybody thinks it's cool
Tanning outside Daddy's pool
I think it's way too late
Time to regenerate

Your hurt infractions you know it
It's not too late it's not too late
Your hurt infractions you know it
There's one chance left
Get on your knees drink the wine
Chew the wafer

People screaming can I be dreaming
Is this the truth I can't tell
Whether this is heaven or hell
Wolfbane and the sound of a silver bell
The air is thick
The smell of death is everywhere
It's all around
But I won't submit to death
You can go with the

Man don't lie why do they cry

Man don't lie why do they cry

Ruling your lives

Don't be late you'll be slammed, you'll be mauled
You'll be thrown into the walls
Everybody thinks it's cool

Sleepless every night
Lie down shading your eyes from everyone

Hey darlin' don't you look fine
So blue all the time
When you're terrified

Over and over the lines
You memorized in time
Now you're so tired
And the telephone's too far away

Phone lives have taken all your time
Taken all this time
For the rest of our lives we're terrified

The photographs they've taken make you look blind
Your costumes made of twine
Now you're forgetting all of your lines again

But hey darlin'
Don't you look fine
Your two front teeth shaved
Like ice and sharp as razors
Hey darlin' don't you look fine
The dull look in your eyes
You're terrified

Holding the hands of our crimes
Darlin' don't you look fine
As brave as we were those days

Doing the best we knew how

They'll kill and demonstrate what fight is all about

The same, the same, I stayed the same

Windows and mirrors like a two-way glass

Yellow bulldozers, the donkey jackets and J.C.B.'s
While hundreds are homeless they're constructing a parking space

Why do they have to knock them down
And leave the site dormant for months on end?
Who has the right to make that choice?
A man whose house has cost forty grand

Tell me!

On the edge of paradise
Tears of woe fall, cold as ice
Hear my cry
Renounce, have you, thy name

Eternal is the pain that leads me to the thrones of temptation
Eternal is the pain that leads me to the thrones of temptation
Eternal is my pain that leads me to the thrones of temptation

II. IN THE ROOM OF THRONES

[Part III - A Gathering of Angels]

There was a time
When nine choirs sang the endless melody of light
Music of the spheres

Threre was a place
Where mortals embraced thunder and majesty
Their fate lay in our hands
Feel my wings slowly fading (ooh)
Forever lost in time (ooh)
I cry (ooh)

[Part IV - The Wrath Divine]

The burning conflict I'm feeling
It summons me to descend into the other side
And just beyond the stars blazing
A beam light from a red, velvet moon illuminates me

I will devise
From perfect skies, a dark and vengeful day
Faith and mercy gone astray

With strength of infinite measure
The mighty sword divides order from chaos in the kingdom below
And from the mansions of glory
This empty soul cries out one final plea – the end has begun

Our worlds collide
Now in disguise you'll feel the Wrath Divine
Tears of woe fall from the sky

[Part V - The Prophet's Cry]
The prophet cries
Vast battalions rage on in the sky
Rising from the north – the bringer of war
Eve of destruction
Summon all who have power over fire
Impending doom from shore to shore

Standing on the edge of paradise
I sacrifice my truth and loyalty
Seven deadly sins consume you all, a dance with death
I taste the victory

Rising from the north – the warrior prince (Eternal is the pain that leads me to temptation)
Judgement without compassion eyes of fear
Like the river styx, the gates of hell (Eternal is the pain that leads me to temptation)
""Abandon hope all ye who enter here""

The prophets cry
As armies fall from the edge of the sky
The Prince of truth, now the bringer of war

The day of wrath
Banish all kings from the face of the land
Dominion for strength is my name

88,Deborah Harry,End Of The Run,sad,"Darkness falls like a black leather jacket and melts into the sidewalk like a sleeping drunk
In the streets, the wind throws yesterday's headlines around
Another night comes and goes

So, for awhile back then there was someplace to go
Somewhere more home than a house
A family of choice, not an accident, but sometimes as soon as something gets started it's over

Now the days are much shorter and the people from the good part of town all come around, but the something is missing even though there's more there now
I shrug off my attempts to explain how a torn t-shirt made it all danger again

I don't like flashbacks in movies
I like the story to proceed
I don't like talking about the old days except if it tells where the future will lead

So we take a walk down this haunted hall or stumble through a shattered recall
I know there's nothing to relive, it's just the shape of it all
I don't want it different
Don't want it again but value for value, now I'd never want it to end
You think of the old friends and faces no more to be seen
You think how much fun a line-up would mean

And once that tape starts playing, it's too hard to make it rewind
That one special face takes over your mind

That end of the run
We almost won
The end of the run
We had our fun
The end of the run
I knew it then
It won't be back again

We stood in the cold night, though we should be warm, in the back of the lot with me in your arms
The sun was falling
The grey rain was pouring
The cars were all dirty and slow
We both had our kiss and, out of the depths and darkness, with my eyes closed I still see you fine
Cause that was the season we make our dreams come true
There was no limit to what we could do

The end of the run
We almost won
The end of the run
We had our fun
The end of the run
I knew it then
He won't be back again

Once that tape starts playing it's too hard to make it rewind
With my eyes closed I still see you fine
That was the season we make our dreams come true

And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong

You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby

Mmmhhh

Oooh!

(groans by Missy Elliott X2)

[VERSE 1]
Bet you realize this time that
When you see my friends sitting outside they were
There to help me pack my bags and
Tell me don't listen to you if you're beggin
Cause they know I'm coming straight back home to you
And they know I'm a constant fool for you
So I'm putting my things on a U-haul
And I'm blockin out your number when you call

[Chorus]
No conversation you can keep your words
Cause 90% I done already heard
How long did you think that I would sit here for?
I'm letting you know it's not exceptional
And No conversation you can save the games
And anything you say I will remain the same
How long did you think that I would sit here for?
Destroying my soul, it ain't exceptional
[VERSE 2]
I can't believe you even tried to blame me
Cause you're the one who changed
I've been the same me
And I been by your side like a 2 way
And like a pager with no clamp
That's how you lose me
So my friends come to help me get over you
Cause they're sick and tired of seeing what I'm going through
I put all of my things on a U-haul
And I won't' accept at all whenever you call

[Chorus]
No conversation you can keep your words
Cause 90% I done already heard
How long did you think that I would sit here for?
I'm letting you know it's not exceptional
And No conversation you can save the games
And anything you say I will remain the same
How long did you think that I would sit here for?
Destroying my soul, it ain't exceptional

[BRIDGE]
I should have left you're ass long time ago
(I should have left you)
I was too scared to be out on my own
(Cause you made me feel like)
You made me feel there was no other way
(I would never find another)
That I wouldn't find love, I would be lonely
Cause you, you (made) made (me) me (feel so damn low)
So low, low low, low low, low low
[VERSE 3]
Now take a look at what's happening
This is tragic like when Michael left The Jacksons
I told you, you should be careful what you're asking
You wished I would've left you with some quiet time
But now you got more time than any time
I know you never thought that I would jet out
But I left before you could tell me ""Get out""

[Chorus]
No conversation you can keep your words
Cause 90% I done already heard
How long did you think that I would sit here for?
I'm letting you know it's not exceptional
And No conversation you can save the games
And anything you say I will remain the same
How long did you think that I would sit here for?
Destroying my soul, it ain't exceptional

93,The Pipettes,Dirty Mind,happy,"He's got a dirty mind, just don't know what you're gonna find

On her way from the school
She saw him, she saw him
In a second she knew
She wanted him, oh she wanted him
There was no trace on him
Of filth, grime or dirt
An overwhelming urge
To smile, laugh and flirt

There she goes with a twinkle in her eye
Don't take a genius to understand the reason why
There she goes with a twinkle in her eye
Don't take a genius to understand the reason why

He's got a dirty mind, just don't know what you're gonna find

This girl he thought she was
Living in a dream
It's just that he was
Exceptionally clean
All the boys that she, that she had known before
Avoided hygiene
Around at his house
You could eat off the floor
Which was slightly unnerving
Hygiene boy, oh what am I to do?
I feel positively filthy standing next to you
Hygiene boy, oh what am I to do?
I feel positively filthy standing next to you

He's got a dirty mind, just don't know what you're gonna find

She got to know his mind intimately
She was surprised to find
Something of an anomaly
You see this perfect boy
Wasn't quite so pristine
He had ideas that would (He had ideas that could)
Make the Devil scream

Dirty mind, don't know what you're gonna find
He's got a dirty mind, just don't know what you're gonna find
Dirty mind, don't know what you're gonna find
He's got a dirty mind, just don't know what you're gonna find

Well, I'm gonna try for all I'm worth
To stay with you till the end of the earth

95,Steve Goodman,My Old Man,sad,"I miss my old man tonight
And I wish he was here with me
With his corny jokes and his cheap cigars
He could look you in the eye and sell you a car
That's not an easy thing to do
But no one ever knew a more charming creature
On this earth than my old man

He was a pilot in the big war in the U.S. Army Air Corps
In a C-47 with a heavy load
Full of combat cargo for the Burma Road
And after they dropped the bomb
He came home and married mom
And not long after that
He was my old man

And oh the fights we had
When my brother and I got him mad
He'd get all boiled up and he'd start to shout
And I knew what was coming so I tuned him out
And now the old man's gone, and I'd give all I own
To hear what he said when I wasn't listening
To my old man

I miss the old man tonight
And I can almost see his face
He was always trying to watch his weight
And his heart only made it to fifty-eight
For the first time since he died
Late last night I cried
I wondered when I was gonna do that
For my old manEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",country

Throw your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say""

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If this is your first time hearing this
You are about to experience something so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty, I looked up to the dope man
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flicking Starter coats, man—man, you don't know, man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer they ain't finna say, ""Next summer, I'm finna...""
Sitting in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sitting your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
You gotta do something, man, your ass is grown

'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody selling makeup, Jacob's
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on lay-away, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Mama say she wanna move South
Scratching lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job
So since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
So niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep bakin' 'til the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say, my niggas—

Drug dealin' just to get by (Yeah)
Stack your money 'til it get sky high

We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive (Alive, uh-huh)
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say"" (Yeah, yeah, ugh)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You know the kids gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song ""12 Questions""
We scream: ""rocks, blow, weed, park,"" see, now we smart
We ain't retards the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now, tell my mama I belong in that slow class
It's bad enough we on welfare
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chrome-y wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes, I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say, my niggas—
[Chorus: Choir & Kanye West]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
Kids, sing! Kids, sing!

For something you ain't never gonna find
If you could just make up your mind

108,Darren Hayes,A Conversation With God,sad,"[Verse 1]
We're driving
Just me and God
It's raining
It's raining hard
The windows
Are steaming up
The bridge engulfed by fog

The rust of
The metal bridge
It beckons
It pulls me in
I argue
I scream at God
And what he's offering

[Chorus]
My hands fly off the steering wheel
Can't recall getting here
If I could, I would reach behind
And turn my light off
My thoughts run off the beaten track
There's no lighthouse or way back
Take the hand of God
And bite the feeder
No more lingering
[Verse 2]
I'm driving
I talk to God
He's screaming
I only nod
I need to
Be where you are
The leaves and trees are shaking

It's raining
The bullets melt
The hunger
Of hunger itself
It's draining
But pain has reservoirs it keeps for itself

[Chorus]
My hands fly off the steering wheel
Can't recall getting here
If I could, I would reach behind
And turn my light off
My thoughts run off the beaten track
There's no lighthouse or way back
Take the hand of God
And bite the feeder
No more lingering
[Bridge]
I'm falling
I'm not myself
I'm diving
I'm underneath
The hull of
A mighty ship
That steams away from here

The bubbles
The surface race
They shine and
They replicate
I hear it
The Voice of God is laced with sarcasm
In your hands

[Chorus]
And my thoughts run off the beaten track
There's no light
How's the way back
Take the hand of God
And bite the feeder
No more lingering
My hands fly off the steering wheel
Can't recall getting here
If I could, I would reach behind
And turn my light offEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",pop
109,Okkervil River,"So Come Back, I Am Waiting",sad,"[Verse 1]
A black sheep boy revolves
Over canyons and waterfalls
A black sheep boy dissolves
In syringe or in shower stall
He says ""there's plenty of time to make you mine tonight""
He says ""there's plenty of time to make you mine""
He says ""there's plenty of ways to know you're not dying
All right
Hell, there's plenty of light still left in your eyes
In your eyes""

[Verse 2]
A black sheep boy grows horns, breathing smoke through his microphone
The airwaves stretch and they groan
Bleeding, birthing his black diapason
He says ""there's plenty of things to wear when you come to me
Every color of sleeve to be rolled
There are millions of rolling eyes that still cling to me
Every language of king is concerned
So why
Did you bawl
From the spell of some old holy song
Some liar laughed as he composed
Some liar I loved to control
[Verse 3]
A black sheep boy dissolves
In hot cream
In sweet moans
In each dead bed and empty home
In each seething bacterium
Killing softly and serial
He lifts his head, handsome, horned, magisterial
He's the smell of the moonlight wisteria
He's the thrill of the abecedarian
(See the muddy hoof prints where he carried you?)

[Verse 4]
And there's plenty of ways to claim his crimes tonight
And there's plenty of things to do on his dime
And there's plenty of ways to wear his hide tonight
You've got yours, I've got mine
You've got yours, I've got mine

[Verse 5]
So why
Did you flee?
Don't you know you can't leave his control
Only call all his wild works your own?
So come back and we'll take them all on
So come back to your life on the lam
So come back to your old black sheep man
He says ""I am waiting on hoof and on hand
I am waiting, all hated and damned
I am waiting, I snort and I stamp
I am waiting
You know that I am
Calmly waiting to make you my lamb""EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",country
110,Bloodhound Gang,The Bad Touch,happy,"[Intro]
Ha-Ha! Well now, we call this the act of mating
But there are several other very important differences
Between human beings and animals that you should know about
(I'd appreciate your input)

[Verse 1]
Sweat baby, sweat baby, sex is a Texas drought
Me and you do the kind of stuff that only Prince would sing about
So put your hands down my pants and I'll bet you'll feel nuts
Yes, I'm Siskel, yes, I'm Ebert and you're getting two thumbs up
You've had enough of two-hand touch, you want it rough, you're out of bounds
I want you smothered, want you covered, like my Waffle House hash browns
Come quicker than FedEx, never reach an apex, just like Coca-Cola stock, you are inclined
To make me rise an hour early, just like Daylight Savings Time

[Chorus]
Do it now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel

Love, the kind you clean up with a mop and bucket
Like the lost catacombs of Egypt, only God knows where we stuck it
Hieroglyphics, let me be Pacific: I wanna be down in your South Seas
But I got this notion that the motion of your ocean means ""Small Craft Advisory""
So, if I capsize on your thighs high tide, B-5, you sunk my battleship
Please turn me on, I'm Mister Coffee with an automatic drip
So show me yours, I'll show you mine, ""Tool Time,"" you'll Lovett just like Lyle
And then we'll do it doggy style so we can both watch ""X-Files""

112,Megadeth,Recipe for Hate...Warhorse,angry,"Part 1: Recipe for Hate

[Verse 1]
Each day, my shortcomings pick my pockets
My faults were letters carved in stone
As meaningful to you as words written in water
I'm left to walk this world alone
In a broken mold they made me
The black sheep of the family
Worth less than zero
My opinion and room temperature IQ
I did something, now I'm nothing
Always wrong with this or that
Poisoned with fear
Watch it twist my measly brain mad

[Verse 2]
Talk about me when my back is turned
Next time we meet, it will be too late
The memory burnt in my ears of what you said
And now I've got a recipe for hate, taste it
Dark clouds on the horizon make it hard to breathe
A walking mistake
But every time I run away
I just come back for more
The choice is clear
I can quit and fall on my sword
Or light a fire to see who runs or stays
And plays the confidence game
Part 2: Warhorse

[Verse 3]
I'm feeling quite invisible
I feel just like thin air
The truth taunts me
That nobody wants me
I see the Earth below me
I watch it spin there
Does someone somewhere out there hear me?
Sentenced to walk in purgatory
My life is running down
I can't believe what they've done to me
I'm left riding a warhorse
A man without a countryEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

Alguém deve estar rindo de você

Motivo, talvez, nem exista

Então por favor não insista

Use a imagem como documento

Não esqueça de esquecer seu talento

Aborte todo-e-qualquer lirismo

Pra não cair em ostracismo

Seja maduro apague a ilusão

De quem tem caráter tem tudo na mão

E se é pra sair bem na fotografia

Venda sua mãe e não perca a simpatia

Não é difícil de comparar
Nosso cérebro com a castanha do Pará

A bem da verdade é bem mais fácil aceitar

O mundo assim do que só contestar

A vida é um processo de constante atuação

Se você quer ser feliz e não apodrecer na solidão

Abaixe a cabeça pra obter atenção

Encolha o rabo e terá admiração

Se quiser ser ouvido é bom ficar calado

E que tudo fique no mesmo estado

I relive the moment
I'm bearing the burden within
Open wounds hidden under my skin

Pain as real as a cut that bleeds
The face I see every time I try to sleep
Is staring at me crying

I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories
Are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

I sever myself from the world
And shut down completely
All alone in my own living hell
Overcome with irrational fear
Under the weight of the world on my chest
I buckle and break as I try to catch my breath
Tell me I'm not dying

Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories
Are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

I'm a prisoner of regret
Between the flashbacks and the violent dreams
I am hanging on the edge

Disaster lurks around the bend
Paradise came to an end
And no magic pill
Can bring it back again

Are etched upon my mind

From harbour walls at close of day
As dusk falls soft I hear
My footsteps echo clear
Across the bay
Up into the starry blue

Rain and tears streaming down my face
Dark chill of this empty place
The night bears witness to
All my heart can hold

I'm left watching all my thoughts collide
Wish I could take back such foolish pride
I felt you understood this love inside
Now it's just an arrow fallen wide
Of all my heart can hold

I realise here beneath this sky
I've never known how to say goodbye
So you just slipped away
From what I had to say
That still connects me to
All my heart can hold

I felt you understood this love inside
Now it's just an arrow fallen wide
Of all my heart can hold
Here in the midnight
Fading shadows reappear
Have I been dreaming for too long?
So many ghosts and fears
Are catching up with me
Don't make me wait too long
Don't make me wait too long

All around me the world is still
I lift my head on this lonely hill
I'll put these stars to flight
Roll back this velvet night
And make a million suns
Shine only on you

I'm left watching all my thoughts collide
Wish I could take back such foolish pride
I felt you understood this love inside

Went half crazy now and then
But he still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again

Dated 1962
He had underlined in red
Every single 'I love you'

Oh but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away

Oh, and we all wondered if she would
And it kept runnin' through my mind

In an old tar paper shack

Past the Parson's place

Underneath that sign always congregated quite a crowd

130,João Gilberto,Chega De Saudade,relaxed,"Vai minha tristeza
E diz a ela
Que sem ela não pode ser
Diz-lhe numa prece que ela regresse
Porque eu não posso mais sofrer

Chega de saudade
A realidade é que sem ela não há paz
Não há beleza, é só tristeza e melancolia
Que não sai de mim, não sai de mim, não sai

Mas se ela voltar, se ela voltar
Que coisa linda, que coisa louca
Pois há menos peixinhos a nadar no mar
Do que os beijinhos que eu darei na sua boca

Dentro dos meus braços
Os abraços hão de ser milhões de abraços
Apertado assim, colado assim, calado assim
Abraços e beijinhos e carinhos sem ter fim
Que é pra acabar com esse negócio de viver longe de mim

Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach

Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm drivin' by your house
Though I know you're not home

But I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got your hair combed back and sunglasses on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream
No, I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
I see you walkin' real slow and you're smilin' at everyone
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
Out on the road today, I saw a Dead Head sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said
""Don't look back. You can never look back.""
I thought I knew what love was
What did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

You turned to me and smiled ""A baby's on the way""
And then you drift asleep to dream of life anew
And I lie wondering just what I should I do...

I could kick you in the stomach and catch you unawares
I could swear to god you accidentally fell that flight of stairs
When I tell you that I love you I will look you in the eye
As I slowly slide the hanger up your thigh...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",country

A thousand sceptic hands won't keep us from the things we plan
Unless we're clinging to the things we prize

Get to 60 and feel no regret

Mlhavá stopa po tvých rtech
A v každém koutě jako čert
Kulhavý skřítek Adalbert
Ještě tě piju v kávě
A snídám v bílé vece
Ještě jsi ve všech věcech

137,Maria Taylor,Two Of Those Too (Album Version),relaxed,"There was a time two fearless minds
Well we packed up for a new place
A college town with a musical sound
And everyone had a new face
There was something there
Maybe it was the trees
Or the flowery air
Or that everyone seemed so glad
They were there
And we were two of those too
We were two of those too

We got a house in between a homeless shelter
And a coffee shop
We painted the walls until we couldn't reach
I said, ""It looks cool this way, let's stop.""

There were always people there
Maybe it was the music
We played on the record player
Or that everyone seemed so glad
They were there
And we were two of those too
We were two of those too

And those were the times
The quietest days
We'll sit and smile and remember
Nothing could feel the same
We were so free
We were in each passing second
And you can't sustain anything
Everything must change
So be thankful for everything

153,Conway Twitty,That's My Job,sad,"[Verse 1]
I woke up cryin' late at night, when I was very young
I had dreamed my father, had passed away and gone
My world revolved around him, I couldn't lie there anymore
So I made my way down, the mirrored hall, and tapped upon his door

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Daddy, I'm so afraid!
How would I go on, with you gone that way?
Don't wanna cry anymore, so may I stay with you?""
And he said ""That's my job, that's what I do
Everything I do is because of you, to keep you safe with me
That's my job, you see.""

[Verse 2]
Later we barely got along, this teenage boy and he
Most of the fights it seems were over different dreams
We each held for me
He wanted knowledge and learning, I wanted to fly out west
I said ""I could make it out there, if I just had the fare
I got half, will you loan me the rest?""

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Daddy, I'm so afraid
There's no guarantee in the plans I've made
And if I should fail, who will pay my way back home?""
And he said ""That's my job, that's what I do
Everything I do is because of you, to keep you safe with me
That's my job, you see.""
[Bridge]
Every person carves his spot, and fills the hole with life
And I pray someday I might, light as bright as he

[Verse 3]
Woke up early one bright fall day, read the tragic news
After all my travels, I settled down, within a mile or two
I make my livin' with words and rhymes, and all this tragedy
Should go into my head and out instead, as bits of poetry

[Chorus]
But I say, ""Daddy I'm so afraid
How will I go on, with you gone this way
How can I come up, with a song to say, ""I love you.""
""That's my job, that's what I do
Everything I do is because of you, to keep you safe with me
That's my job, you see.""

Sometimes I feel like I’m playing on the radio
Sometimes I feel like I’m on a travelling road show
Sometimes I got the power of the will
And I know my song is going to be all right

Sometimes I feel like I’m on a freight train
Forever rescued by the mystery rain
Sometimes I’m just out for a thrill
She always said, baby, you're going to be all right

The sun going to come shining down
Push it all away, make it all right
Sometimes in the heart of a long, cold night
It's all too far out of sight, out of sight

Hard to know everything's going to be all right
Everyone thinks you got everything you want
Hard to have and then have not
Hard to have and then have not

Sometimes I want to take a pill and hide
Sometimes I want to shut down and ride
And go where no man should go
Go where no man should go
Go where no man should go
Go where no man should go

Ooh, oh yeah
Ooh, oh yeah
Ooh, oh Yeah

[Verse 1]
You insult me in my home, you're forgiven this time
Things go well, your eyes dilate, you shake and ""I'm high""
Look in my eyes deep and watch the clouds change with time
Twenty hours won't print my picture milk carton size
Carton size, carton size, carton size

[Verse 2]
Call me up, congratulations ain't the real why
There's no pressure besides brilliance let's say by day nine
Endless corporate ignorance lets me control time
""By the way"", ""by the way"", ""by the way"", ""by the way""

Once again, you see an in
Discolored skin gives you away
So afraid, you kindly gurgle
Out a date for me

Now the body of one soul I adore wants to die
You have always told me you'd not live past twenty-five
I say stay long enough to repay all who caused strife

Once again, you see an in
Discolored skin gives you away
So afraid, you kindly gurgle
Out a date for me

[Outro]
I bear true and an existing witness
To this barrel of monkeys
A self-proclaimed immoral success
Perfected by each whereof
Individually deadly, and equally so
And spread about the surrendered troops
For even thousands of miles
Will not tear apart their communication
Or the lack thereof
Vultures, liars, thieves, each proclaim their innocence
In no suggestion or rhyme
Your weapon is contained
In the wrecking of the keeping the desired effect
The breaking of the spirit thwarts the whole being
Your weapon is guilt
Your weapon is guilt
Your weapon is guilt

Hoy es un día de aquellos
En que miro hacia el cielo
Tratando de descifrar el que estés
De vez en cuando lejos
Y de vez en cuando cerca
Unas veces subir y otras caer

Y yo cuando tú te me acercas
No respondo de mis actos
Siento que aquí voy
De odiarte, a quererte
De principio a fin
Buscando un poco de amor

From Dublin to Babylon

Jump it out and jump it in
From Kingston to Providenceland

Hay cosas en la vida
En que no encuentras salida
Y ante tus ojos se cierra el telón
Y tapas la boquilla del volcán que se hace lava
Que hace mil años esta aquí dentro

Para ver si puedo atraparte
Y aquí voy colando la masilla

170,Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds,Oh My Lord,sad,"[Verse 1]
I thought I'd take a walk today
It's a mistake I sometimes make
My kids lay asleep in bed
My wife lay wide-awake
I kissed her softly on the brow
I tried not to make a sound
But with stony eyes she looked at me
And gently squeezed my hand
Call it a premonition, call it a crazy vision
Call it intuition, something learned from mother
But when she looked up at me, I could clearly see
The Sword of Damocles hanging directly above her

[Chorus]
Oh Lord Oh my Lord
Oh Lord
How have I offended thee?
Wrap your tender arms around me
Oh Lord Oh Lord
Oh My Lord

[Verse 2]
They called at me through the fence
They were not making any sense
They claimed that I had lost the plot
Kept saying that I was not
The man I used to be
They held their babes aloft
Threw marsh mellows at the Security
And said that I'd grown soft
Call it intuition, call it a creeping suspicion
But their words of derision meant they hardly knew me
For even I could see in the way they stared at me
The Spear of Destiny sticking right through me
[Chorus]
Oh Lord Oh my lord
Oh Lord
How have I offended thee?
Wrap your tender arms round me
Oh Lord Oh lord
Oh My Lord

[Verse 3]
Now I'm at the hairdressers
People watch me as they move past
A guy wearing plastic antlers
Presses his bum against the glass
Now I'm down on my hands and knees
And it's so fucking hot!
Someone cries, ""What are you looking for?""
I scream, ""The plot, the plot!""
I grab my telephone, I call my wife at home
She screams, ""Leave us alone!"" I say, ""Hey, it's only me""
The hairdresser with his scissors, he holds up the mirror
I look back and shiver; I can't even believe what I can see

[Verse 4]
Be mindful of the prayers you send
Pray hard but pray with care
For the tears that you are crying now
Are just your answered prayers
The ladders of life that we scale merrily
Move mysteriously around
So that when you think you're climbing up, man
In fact you're climbing down
Into the hollows of glamour, where with spikes and hammer
With telescopic camera, they chose to turn the screw
Oh I hate them, Ma! Oh I hate them, Pa!
Oh I hate them all for what they went and done to you
[Chorus]
Oh Lord Oh my Lord
Oh Lord
How have I offended thee?
Wrap your tender arms round me
Oh Lord Oh Lord

I swear I know your face
I wish I knew your name
I wish I could take you by the hand
If I could name it
If I could just explain it
If I could only help you
Help you understand
I can see that you're hurting
Weighed down like a beast of burden
About to break your back
God only knows that you're human
So what are they trying to do then
Believe me, they don't understand

[Chorus]
That you have the weight of the world today
It's on your back
A heavy load like that is gonna hold you back
It's gonna drag you down
You know it just can't last, just can't
You know it just can't last

[Verse 2]
They thought they could use you
Push you down and abuse you
And what's so sad is you've decided to hide
All your feelings
Got more pain than you can deal with
But ask yourself how can this last

I hope that our few remaining friends
Give up on trying to save us
I hope we come up with a fail-safe plot
To piss off the dumb few that forgave us
I hope the fences we mended
Fall down beneath their own weight
And I hope we hang on past the last exit
I hope it's already too late

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I hope the junkyard a few blocks from here
Someday burns down
And I hope the rising black smoke carries me far away
And I never come back to this town again

[Chorus 1]
In my life
I hope I lie, and tell everyone you were a good wife
And I hope you die
I hope we both die

[Verse 2]
I hope I cut myself shaving tomorrow
I hope it bleeds all day long
Our friends say it's darkest before the sun rises
We're pretty sure they're all wrong
I hope it stays dark forever
I hope the worst isn't over
And I hope you blink before I do
And I hope I never get sober

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I hope when you think of me years down the line
You can't find one good thing to say
And I'd hope that if I found the strength to walk out
You'd stay the hell out of my way

I am drowning
There is no sign of land
You are coming down with me
Hand in unlovable hand
And I hope you die
I hope we both die18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

Wine is fine, but whiskey's quicker
Suicide is slow with liquor
Take a bottle and drown your sorrows

Evil thoughts and evil doings
Cold, alone you hang in ruins
Thought that you'd escape The Reaper
You can't escape the Master Keeper

Such a shame who's to blame and you're wondering why
Then you ask from your cask is there life after birth
What you saw can be Hell on this earth, Hell on this earth

Now you live inside a bottle
The Reaper's traveling at full throttle
It's catching you but you don't see
The Reaper's you and The Reaper is me

Made your bed, rest your head, but you lie there and moan
Where to hide, Suicide is the only way out

Ah, ah you got it, fox

Well, I saw the thing comin' out of the sky
It had a-one long horn and one big eye. (Ooh!)
I commenced to shakin' and I said, ""Ooh-eee!
It looks like a purple people eater to me!""

It was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
(One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater)
A one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
Sure looks strange to me (One eye?)

Well, he came down to earth and he lit in a tree
I said, ""Mr. Purple People Eater, don't eat me!""
I heard him say in a voice so gruff:
""I wouldn't eat you 'cause you're so tough.""

It was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
Sure looks strange to me (One horn?)

I said, ""Mr. Purple People Eater, what's your line?""
He said, ""Eatin' purple people and it sure is fine
But that's not the reason that I came to land
I wanna get a job in a rock and roll band.""
Well bless my soul, rock and roll, flyin' purple people eater
Pigeon-toed, undergrowed, flyin' purple people eater
(We wear short shorts)
Friendly little people eater
What a sight to see! (Oooh!)

And then he swung from the tree and he lit on the ground
He started to rock, really rockin' around
It was a crazy ditty with a swingin' tune
Sing a bop bap aboopa lappa loom bam boom

Well bless my soul, rock and roll, flyin' purple people eater
Pigeon-toed, undergrowed, flyin' purple people eater
""I like short shorts""
Flyin' little people eater
What a sight to see! (Purple People?)

And then he went on his way, and then what do ya know
I saw him last night on a TV show
He was blowing it out, a'really knockin' em dead
Playin' rock and roll music through the horn in his head

Let me introduce myself
I'm a social disease
I've come for your wealth
Leave you on your knees
No time for feeling sorry
I got here on my own
I won't ask for mercy
I choose to walk alone

[Pre-Chorus]
What's yours is mine
What's mine is mine too
If you shake my hand
Better count your fingers

[Chorus]
What if I do get caught?
What if there is no judgement?
If I'm right, I lose nothing
If you're right, I lose it all
I ought to get caught
Because I'm doing something wicked
I'm guilty, haunted by my fears
And the only consequences are dread and the fugitive mind
[Verse 2]
You built walls to protect you
So no-one will infect you
Pursued by those out there
That vanish in thin air
Come a long way to find
What you really left behind
You don't know when the end is
But it's coming fast

What's yours is mine
What's mine is mine too
If you shake my hand
Better count your fingers

Your shadow walks faster than you
You don't really know what to do
Do you think that you're not alone?
You really think that you are immune to it
It's going to get that the best of you
It's going to lift you up and let you down
Mmm-mmm-mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
It will defeat you then teach you to get back up
After it takes away all that
You learn to love

[Verse 2]
Your reflection is a blur
Out of focus
But in confusion
The frames are suddenly burnt
And in the end of a roll of illusion
A ghost waiting its turn
Now I can see right through
It's a warning that nobody heard

[Pre-Chorus]
It will teach you to love what you're afraid of
After it takes away all that
You learn to love
But you don't always have to hold your head
Higher than your heart

You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better be hoping you're not so
Hope you're not alone

[Verse 3]
Your echo comes back out of tune
Now you can quite get used to it
Reverb is just a room
The problem is that there's no truth to it
It's fading way too soon
The shadow is on the move
And maybe you should be moving too

Before it takes away all that you learned to love
It will defeat you and then teach you to get back up

182,Rage Against the Machine,How I Could Just Kill A Man,angry,"[Verse 1]
Hey, don't miss out on what you're passing
You're missing the hootah of the funky Buddha
Eluder of the fucked up styles that get wicked
So come on as I start to kick it
'Cause we're like outlaws stridding
Suckers are hiding
Jump behind the bush
When they see me driving by
Hanging out my window
And my magnum taking out some putos
Acting kinda loco
I'm just another local kid
From the street getting paid for my vocals
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

[Chorus 1]
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
[Verse 2]
I've been doin' all the dumb shit, yo, because nothin' is coming from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fucking around, I got ya humming
Hummin', comin' at ya
Then you know I had to gat ya
Time for some action, just a fraction of friction (Uh)
I got the clearance to run the interference
Into your satellite, shining a battle light
Swing out the gat, and I know that we'll gat you right
Here's an example, just a little sample
How I could just kill a man
One time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said, ""Yo, it's on
Take cover son, or you're assed out
How do you like my chrome?"" Then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast him but I did any way
Ha ha ha ha ha! Young punk had to pay
So I just killed the man

[Chorus 1]
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
[Bridge]
It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I have to establish
To light my spliff, ignite you with these site
So if you ain't down
Bullshit

[Verse 3]
Say some punk tried to get you for your auto
Would call the one time and play the role model?
No, I think you'll play like a thug
Next, hear the shot of a magnum slug
Humming, coming at ya!
Yeah, you know I'm gonna to gat ya
How do you know where I'm at
When you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm coming from
While you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here risking my dome, just for a bucket, or a fast ducat
Just to stay alive, yo, I gotta say, ""Fuck it""

Here is something you can't understand

Would you get down on yours too and take my hand?
Would we get that old time feelin'? Would we laugh and talk for hours?

Would you tell me that you've missed me too and that you've been so lonely?
And you've waited for the day that I returned
And we'd live and love forever, and that I'm your one and only

And all I saw was his face
Smiling, the needle crying
Walking out of his room with mirrors
Afraid, I heard him scream
'You'll never get away'

Cold and shaking
I crawled down alleys to try
And scrape away the tracks that marked me
Slammed my face into walls of concrete
I stared, amazed at the words written on the wall

Don't ever trust the needle, it lies
Don't ever trust
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries
Cries your name

The needle keeps calling me back
To bloody my hands forever
Carved my cure with the blade

Now every time I'm weak
Words scream from my arm

Don't ever trust the needle, it lies

But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear, my dear

You make me laugh, you make me cry

Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

It's awkward and silent as I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now, your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I'll delete it

Oh, I'm not comin' back
You're taking seven steps here

When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry

When we're intertwined, everything's alright

I´ve opened up my heart so many times
But now it´s closed
Oh my dear every salted tear
It wrings

Bitter - sweet applause
But when the show´s in full swing
Every once in a while
High stepping chorus lines
Mean i´m forgetting
Mein lullaby - liebchen
How rich in contrast
Love can be

Sometimes i´m quite amused
To see it twist and turn
To taste - both sweet and dry
These vintage years!
Lovers you consume, my friend
As others their wine

Nein - das ist nicht
Das ende der welt
Gestrandet an leben und kunst
Und das spiel geht weiter
Wie man weiss
Noch viele schönste...wiedersehn
And now, as you turn to leave
You try to force a smile -
As if to compensate -
Then you break down and cry

Lucy clutched her breast in fear
She heard a beat of her lover’s heart
For weeks she raved in dreams he appeared
From far off Transylvania

Only a woman can break his spell
Pure in heart, who will offer herself
To Nosferatu

The ship pulled in without a sound
The faithful captain long since cold
He kept his log ’til the bloody end
Last entry read “rats in the hold
My crew is dead—I fear the plague”

Pure in heart, who will offer herself

Sickness now, then horrible death
Only Lucy knew the truth
And at her window

So chaste, so calm, she gave herself
To the pleasure of the dreaded master
He sucked the precious drops of life
Throughout the long and cold, dark night

One last goodbye (goodbye), he was blinded by love

The spell was broken with a kiss of doom
He vanished into dust, left her all alone

202,Five Iron Frenzy,My Evil Plan To Save The World,happy,"I have an evil plan to save the world for every man
And I think it's better than the way it's being run
Oh the groundwork's laid
No, don't be afraid
I'm sure that I can fix it
When I figure out the physics

My evil plan to save the world
Just you wait 'till it's unfurled
It'll go down in history
It's prophetic
No, it's not pathetic
I can't believe I made it up myself

I have an evil plan
To save the world you understand
The exemplary feat
You'd think I'd have to cheat
I'd make Voltaire proud
Deep and furrow browed
Uncanny and so clever
It's ""Our Newest Plan Ever!""

Got tired of whining
A grander scheme with silver lining
For every boy and girl
We can't be responsible
For all that's wrong with this world
My evil plan to save the world
Just you wait 'till it's unfurled
It'll go down in history
It's prophetic
No, it's not pathetic
I can't believe I made it up myself

Starving children in pain
You can't believe in that god
The world's not spinning your way
Does every dog still have his day?

My evil plan to save the world
Just you wait 'till it's unfurled
It'll go down in history, yeah
It's prophetic
No, it's not pathetic
I can't believe I made it up myself

Will you meet me at all?

Jump a rope or skip a line or two

Walking down the corridor
Looking out the picture window down
On Sycamore

While perspective lines converge
Rows of cars and buses merge
All the sweet green trees of Atlanta burst
Like little bombs
Or little pom-poms
Shaken by a careless hand
That drives them off
And leaves again

Life just kind of empties out
Less a deluge than a drought
Less a giant mushroom cloud
Than an unexploded shell
Inside a cell
Of the Lenox Hotel

On the 22nd floor
Found a notice on my door
While outside, the sun is shining on

We go back to your house
You check the charts
And start to figure it out

And if it's crowded, all the better
Because we know we're gonna be up late
But if you're worried about the weather
Then you picked the wrong place to stay
That's how it starts

And so it starts
You switch the engine on
We set controls for the heart of the sun
One of the ways that we show our age

And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up
And I still don't wanna stagger home
Then it's the memory of our betters
That are keeping us on our feet

You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again
Oh, you're talking 45 turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend
It comes apart
The way it does in bad films
Except the part
Where the moral kicks in

And when we're running out of the drugs
And the conversation's grinding away
I wouldn't trade one stupid decision
For another five years of life

Oh, you drop the first ten years just as fast as you can
And the next ten people who are trying to be polite
When you're blowing 85 days in the middle of France
Yeah, I know it gets tired, only where are your friends tonight?

And to tell the truth
Oh, this could be the last time
So here we go
Like a sales force into the night

And if I made a fool, if I made a fool, if I made a fool
On the road, there's always this
And if I'm sued into submission
I can still come home to this

And with a face like a dad and a laughable stand
You can sleep on the plane or review what you said
When you're drunk and the kids look impossibly tanned
You think over and over ""Hey, I'm finally dead.""
Oh, if the trip and the plan come apart in your hand
You can turn it on yourself you ridiculous clown
You forgot what you meant when you read what you said
And you knew you were tired
But then where are your friends tonight?

Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?

To all those souls at rest

Bushes and briars, you and I
Where do we stand?
I wonder if he knows I'm here
Watching the briars grow
And all these people beneath my shoes
I wonder if they know

Knew a clergy's chosen man

We ran
We starved the things that feel
Out back
The drunken waters steal from me

If we beat him down, will he stay?
He's a little dizzy
I feel it starting to take me
Where did everybody go?
I need them now
To save me

We fell
When they choked the things that feed
How come...
We hurt the one's we need?
Lie down
And stretch upon the sea

I wondered all night, I wondered all night about-
You-o-o-oo
I`ve been here for years, just wanderin` round the neighbor-
Hoo-oo-oood

Like a fresh manifestation of an old phenomenon
A breeze whips through the trees
The rustling leaves and branches bend together
They're cued to sway
Forever by the forces of the Lord's choreography

I wondered all night, I wondered all night about-
You-o-o-oo
I`ve been here for years, just wanderin` round the neighbor-
Hoo-oo-oood

Just for a second the combination of sights, sounds
Around him
Sends him hurtling back to the mirror of all of his teenager thoughts and fears
He passes big houses and family cars
They saddled the horses in cobblestone yards
He catches the moon looking down from the stars
Just like it's done for years and years
I won-dered
I won-dered

Perpetual feeling in the grown up world that's all
Around him
That there's secrets that could be revealed with knowledge and philosophy
And ""Oh to be dumb, Oh to be smart""
He might be nursing a broken heart
But feeling this way he's just playing a part
That's been around for centuries

I wandered all night, I wondered all night about you
I've been here for years just wandering around the neighborhoodEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men
For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O Lord
They run and prepare themselves, awake to help me, and behold
But I will sing of thy power

Excerpt from Psalm 22 (King James Version)
My God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?
O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent
Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help
Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round
They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels
My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death
For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet
I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me
They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture
But be not thou far from me, O Lord: O my strength, haste thee to help meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

245,"""Weird Al"" Yankovic",The Night Santa Went Crazy,happy,"[Verse 1]
Down in the workshop, all the elves were making toys
For the good Gentile girls and the good Gentile boys
When the boss busted in, nearly scared them half to death
Had a rifle in his hands and cheap whiskey on his breath
From his beard to his boots, he was covered with ammo
Like a big fat drunk disgruntled Yuletide Rambo
And he smiled as he said with a twinkle in his eye
""Merry Christmas to all! Now you're all gonna die!""

[Chorus]
The night Santa went crazy
The night Saint Nick went insane
Realized he'd been getting a raw deal
Something finally must have snapped in his brain

[Verse 2]
Well, the workshop is gone now—he decided to bomb it
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet
And he tied up his helpers, and he held the elves hostage
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage
He got Dancer and Prancer with an old German Luger
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger
And he picked up a flamethrower and he barbecued Blitzen
And he took a big bite and said, ""It tastes just like chicken!""
[Chorus]
The night Santa went crazy
The night Kris Kringle went nuts
Now you can hardly walk around the North Pole
Without stepping in reindeer guts

There's the National Guard and the FBI
There's a van from the Eyewitness News
And helicopters circlin' 'round in the sky
And the bullets are flyin', the body count's risin'

My, my, my, my, my, my
You used to be such a jolly guy

Yes, Virginia, now Santa's doing time
In a federal prison for his infamous crime
Hey, little friend now, don't you cry no more tears
He'll be out with good behavior in seven hundred more years
But now Vixen's in therapy, and Donner's still nervous
And the elves all got jobs working for the postal service
And they say Mrs. Claus, she's on the phone every night
With her lawyer, negotiating the movie rights

They're talkin' 'bout
[Chorus]
The night Santa went crazy
The night Saint Nicholas flipped
Broke his back for some milk and cookies
Sounds to me like he was tired of gettin' gypped

Wo-oh, the night Santa went crazy
The night Saint Nick went insane
Realized he'd been getting a raw deal
Something finally must have snapped in his brain
Wo-oh, something finally must have snapped in his brain
Tell ya, something finally must have snapped... in his brainEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

248,Juanes,Nada Valgo Sin Tu Amor,happy,"[Letra de ""Nada Valgo Sin Tu Amor""]

[Verso 1]
Cuando el tiempo pasa y nos hacemos viejos nos empieza a parecer
Que pesan más los daños que los mismos años al final
Por eso yo quiero que mis años pasen junto a ti, mi amor eterno
Junto a mi familia junto a mis amigos y mi voz

[Pre-Coro]
Porque nada valgo, porque nada tengo si no tengo lo mejor
Tu amor y compañía en mi corazón

[Verso 2]
Y es que vale más un año tardío que un siglo vacío, amor
Y es que vale más tener bien llenito el corazón
Por eso yo quiero que en mi mente siempre tu cariño esté bien fuerte
Aunque estemos lejos o aunque estemos cerca del final

[Pre-Coro]
Porque nada valgo, porque nada tengo si no tengo lo mejor
Tu amor y compañía en mi corazón
Ven, amor

[Coro]
Me siento débil cuando estoy sin ti
Y me hago fuerte cuando estás aquí
Sin ti yo ya no sé qué es vivir
Mi vida es un tunel sin tu luz
Quiero pasar más tiempo junto a ti
Recuperar las noches que perdí
Vencer el miedo inmenso de morir
Y ser eterno junto a ti
[Pre-Coro]
Porque nada valgo, porque nada tengo si no tengo lo mejor
Tu amor y compañía en mi corazón

[Solo de guitarra]

[Verso 3]
Y si yo pudiera detener el tiempo y volver a comenzar
Borrar todo lo que un día me hizo tanto, pero tanto mal
Borrar el odio y también las penas y una a una las tristezas
Y dibujar solo tu cariño en su lugar

[Pre-Coro]
Porque nada valgo, porque nada tengo si no tengo lo mejor
Tu amor y compañía en mi corazón
Ven, amor

[Coro]
Me siento débil cuando estoy sin ti
Y me hago fuerte cuando estás aquí
Sin ti yo ya no sé qué es vivir
Mi vida es un tunel sin tu luz
Quiero pasar más tiempo junto a ti
Recuperar las noches que perdí
Vencer el miedo inmenso de morir
Y ser eterno junto a ti
[Pre-Coro]
Porque nada valgo, porque nada tengo si no tengo lo mejor
Tu amor y compañía en mi corazónEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",latin

[Intro]
Ugh! (Woo!)
What up, y'all? Yeah
(Soundtrakk, what's poppin', baby?)
Woo! (Ugh)
If y'all ain't know
I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
(Kick, push, coast)
Representing that First and Fifteenth, yeah, uh
And this one right here
I dedicate this one right here (Uproxx...)
To all my homies out there grinding
You know what I'm saying? Legally and illegally, haha
You know what I'm talking about? (Woo!)
So, check it out, uh

[Verse 1]
First got it when he was six, didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact, first time he got on it, he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp, like thisss... (Ugh)
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit, it was something in the air (Ugh)
Yeah, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling, something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it
Branded, since the first kickflip he landed, ugh (Woo)
Labeled a misfit, a bandit
Ka-kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk; his neighbors couldn't stand it
So, he was banished to the park
Started in the morning, wouldn't stop 'til after dark, yeah
When they said ""It's getting late in here
So I'm sorry, young man, there's no skating here""
[Hook]
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

[Bridge]
So let's kick... (Ugh)
And push (Y-yeah, y-yeah-yeah)
And coast
Uh, uh, uh (Y-yeah, y-yeah-yeah)

[Verse 2]
My man got a little older, became a better roller
Yeah, no helmet, hell bent on killing himself
Is what his mama said, but he was feeling himself
Got a little more swagger in his style
Met his girlfriend, she was clapping in the crowd
Love is what-what was happening to him now, ugh!
He said ""I would marry you
But I'm engaged to these aerials and varials
And I don't think this board is strong enough to carry two""
She said ""Bow! I weigh a hundred and twenty pounds"" (Woo!)
""Now, let me make one thing clear
I don't need to ride yours, I got mine right here""
So she took him to a spot he didn't know about
Some odd-end apartment parking lot
She said ""I don't normally take dates in here""
Security came and said ""I'm sorry, there's no skating here""
[Hook]
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away they roll
Just lovers intertwined with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

[Bridge]
So let's kick (Ugh, ugh)
And push, yeah, yeah (Woo, woo)
And coast... (Yeah, ugh!)
(Haha, swanky)
Yeah, yeah!

[Verse 3]
Before he knew, he had a crew that wasn't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing, they said (They said...)
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy, they needed to break out
They'd head... to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs, ugh!
And their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said, ""There's no skating here""
[Hook]
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come roll with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

[Bridge]
So let's kick (Ugh, ugh)
And push, yeah, yeah (Woo, woo)
And coast...

An even strobe
A pulse
Of flashing hate lights
Of synthetic souls
Mass produced
Hammered into shape

A sign of times
Dreams turn
Into systems
A new way
A new breed
Implanted in our minds

Here I am
In the hand of
Sterile hate
The new control
I cannot wake
I'm not asleep

[Verse 2]
New intelligence
Arise
In emptied bodies
Turgid flesh
Tested
Through eternal spastic fits
Through not
Known codes
Mother machine
In genocide
Now scorn
A dying race

Evolution
In reverse
Now it's time for me
Changing
What am I to be
Contorted
An eternity
Defeated

Programmed to appease you
We're symbols of perfection
Humanoids ruined by your laws
Destroy erase improve

Lesson first submission
We're docile servant dogs
Our leashes are your limbs
Computed deep within
[Interlude & Solo]

Remoted minds
Controlled our thoughts
No more doubts
The new way is here
Disgorged
Another thousand fakes
That obey
To a circuit skein
To vacuum

Mechanical thoughts
I now conceive no longer me
Always to see inanity
Millions to be units like me
Eternally

Human patterns
Copied, dissected, distorted
Completed to fit the machine
The nerve fibers give in to cords
To the unknown

See me
Be me
Same contents
Same machine
The currency
Of ours no more
Flesh and bone
We are to be
Unaware
Of what we have been before

Evolution
In reverse
Now it's time for me
Changing
What am I to be
Contorted
An eternity
Defeated

Bass! How low can you go?
Death row? What a brother know
Once again, back is the incredible rhyme animal
The uncannable D, Public Enemy Number One
Five-O said, ""Freeze!""—and I got numb
Can I tell 'em that I really never had a gun?
But it's the wax that the Terminator X spun
Now they got me in a cell 'cause my records, they sell
Cause a brother like me said ""Well
Farrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
What he can say to you, what you ought to do is follow for now""
Power of the people say
""Make a miracle, D, pump the lyrical""
Black is back, all in, we're gonna win
Check it out, yeah y'all, come on, here we go again

Ayo Chuck, they're saying we're too black, man
Yo, I don't understand what they're saying
But little do they know they can get a smack for that, man
[Verse 2]
Never badder than bad cause the brother is madder than mad
At the fact that's corrupt like a senator
Soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope
'Cause the beats and the lines are so dope
Listen for lessons I'm saying inside music that the critics are blasting me for
They'll never care for the brothers and sisters now, 'cause the country has us up for the war
We got to demonstrate, come on now
They're gonna have to wait 'till we get it right
Radio stations I question their blackness
They call themselves black, but we'll see if they'll play this

Get from in front of me, the crowd runs to me
My DJ is warm, he's X, I call him Norm, ya know
He can cut a record from side to side
So what, the ride, the glide should be much safer than a suicide
Soul control, beat is the father of your rock'n'roll
Music for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band, man
Making a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, ya know
You call 'em demos, (but we ride limos, too)
Whatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you
Beat is for Sonny Bono, (Beat is for Yoko Ono)
Run-DMC first said a DJ could be a band
Stand on its own feet, get you out your seat
Beat is for Eric B. and LL as well, hell
Wax is for Anthrax, still it can rock bells
Ever forever, universal, it will sell
Time for me to exit, Terminator X-it

Word up, better keep tellin' me to turn it down

From coast to coast, so you stop being like a comatose
""Stand, my man? The beat's the same with a boast toast""
Rock with some pizzazz, it will last. Why you ask?
Roll with the rock stars, still never get accepted as
We got to plead the Fifth, you can investigate
Don't need to wait, get the record straight
Hey, posse in effect, got the Flavor, Terminator
X to sign checks, play to get paid
We got to check it out down on the avenue
A magazine or two is dissing me and dissing you
Yeah, I'm telling you

Hey yo, Griff, get thirty S1W, we got to handle this
We ain't goin' out like that
Yo man, straight up on the Columbo tip

Like a willow
Off the arm of yet another visionary
Profitous East Van. Punk

To say hello or goodbye
Or stand the test of time
You did, I just tried to
Separate an ocean from these tears we cried

Where did you get that look?
Where did you get that penchant for destruction in the way you talk?
Where did you get that ride?
Where did you get that rocket?
Where did you get that painter in your pocket?

Fall upon that sword and never look back

And you won't be the moon above us on the moonlit night
And you won't be the stars in heaven although they burn so bright
But even on the deepest ocean you will be the light

You may not always shine as you go barefoot over stones
You might be so long together or you might walk alone
And you'll find that love comes easy
Or that love is always right
So even when the storm clouds gather you will be the light

And if you lose a parting side when love turns round on you
Leaving the past behind is knowing you'll do like you always
Holding you blind
Keeping you true

You'll never be the sun turning in the sky
And you won't be the moon above us on the moonlit night
And you won't be the stars in heaven although they burn so bright

Let's go inside my astral plane
Find out my mental, based on instrumental
Records, hey, so I can write monumental
Methods, I'm not the king
But niggas is decaf, I stick 'em for the cream
Check it, just how deep can shit get
Deep as the abyss and brothers is mad, fish accept it
In your Cross Colour clothes, you've crossed over
Then got Totally Krossed Out and Kris Krossed
Who the boss? Niggas get tossed to the side
And I'm the dark side of the Force
Of course it's the Method, Man from the Wu-Tang Clan
I be hectic, and comin' for the head piece, protect it
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket
Niggas want the ruckus
Bustin' at me, bruh, now bust it
Styles, I gets buckwild
Method Man on some shit, pullin' niggas files, I'm sick
Insane, crazy, driving Miss Daisy
Out her fucking mind, now I got mine, I'm Swayze

Is it real, son, is it really real, son?
Let me know it's real, son, if it's really real

Brothers wanna hang with the Meth, bring the rope
The only way you'll hang is by the neck
Nigga, bolt off the set, comin' to your projects
Take it as a threat, better yet it's a promise
Comin' from a vet on some old Vietnam shit
Nigga, you can bet your bottom dollar, hey, I bomb shit
And it's gonna get even worse, word to God
It's the Wu comin' through, stickin' niggas for they garments
Movin' on your left, southpaw, Mr. Meth
Came to represent and carve my name in your chest
You can come test, realize you're no contest
Son, I'm the gun that won that old Wild West
Quick on the draw with my hands on the four-
Nine-three-eleven with the rugged rhymes galore
Check it, 'cause I think not when this hip-hops like proper
Rhymes be the proof while I'm drinkin' 90 proof
Huh, vodka, no OJ, no straw
When you give it to me, ayy, give it to me raw
I've learned that when you drink Absolut straight it burns
Enough to give my chest hairs a perm
I don't need a chemical blow to pull a ho
All I need is Chemical Bank to pay the roll

What, basically that, Meth-Tical, '94 style (Northern spicy brown mustard hoes, word up, we be hazardous)
We have to stick you

Let me know it's real, son, if it's really real (Slide you down a rusty razor blade into a pool of alcohol)

Want it raw deal, son, if it's really real

Since those three days

Did you only want me for those three days?
Did you only need me for those three days?
Did you love me forever just for those three days?

You built a nest inside my soul
You rest your head on leaves of gold
You managed to crawl inside my brain
You found a hole and in you came
You sleep like a baby breathing
Comfortably between truth and pain
But the truth is nothing's been the same

You can return those stars back to the skies, the world needs them more

I bet you never thought it could be that bad, that nothing else could bring you back
But when the world was cold and black, you got by, and you survived

They say it gets easier at the end of everyday, so why do I wake up with tears?
You can turn a phrase 10million ways, and still it won't be true

Love is gravity with a pull that you can't deny, thats why you're always falling
But when you hit the ground you can't stay down, your life is calling

I bet you never thought it could be that bad, that nothing else could bring you back

279,British Sea Power,The Lonely,sad,"Since I find out that all of this
Is nothing more than emptiness
Filled with impermanence
A guided tour of your deepest fears
Designed to help you vision clear
We'll depart from here

And when the strangest feeling drifted over me
Oh we'll begin where you give in now baby dear

Thou art so misunderstood

I'll drink all day and play by night
Upon my casio, electric piano
Till in the darkness I see lights
No nor candelabra
But things from other stars

Just like Liberace
I will return to haunt you with peculiar piano riffs

So take it back, back to the start
Rip out your lily livered hearts
And hand them over in a vacuum sealed jar
I say I will not take half the risk
I will not walk half deceased
I believe bravery exists
And the strangest feeling drifted over me

Thou art so misunderstood

I'll drink all day and play by night
Upon my casio, electric piano
Till in the darkness I see lights
No nor candelabra
But things from other stars

I'll drink all day and play by night

To a warm horizon
Shadows of falling leaves
October moon and rusty skies
Ever changing feelings
The seeds of autumn in my mind

The hiding sun, like the hiding sun
Feels like it's just begun
The hiding sun, like the hiding sun
Waiting for summer sun

Hiding summer's age no more
No more leaves in summer sky
Turning dark on empty car lots
When summer was my only friend

So you're back this way again
Winter's one breath away
So you're back this way again
Winter's one breath away
It's turning cold...

Short cut is better by far
Explosive bolts, ten thousand volts
At a million miles an hour
Abrasive wheels and molten metals
It's a semi-automatic, get in the car
Corrosive heart and frozen heat
We're worlds apart where we could meet
Where the street fold round and the motors start
And the idiot wields the power
Where the chosen hold the highest card
On the field of honour where the ground is hard
So the highest hand is joking wild
And the house soon fold and no-one stand
I put my finger on and dialled
The tower, the moon, the gun, and
Nine nine nine, singer down
Cloudburst and all around
The first are last, the blessed get wired
The best is yet to come
I put my finger on and fired
Heat-seeking, out of the sun
You can set the controls for the heart or the knees
And the meek'll inherit what they damn well please
Get ahead, go figure, go ahead and pull the trigger

I need to find myself again, to much of my life is spent on the weekend
Now here comes Monday again, I don't feel great cuz I can't pretend
That the night time hasn't come to got the upper hand
While I'm movin' through the world and I'm movin' through the land
You might make money and you might make grand
You're alone on your own two feet you've gotta stand
Life suck you say the? Will leave you empty
And he's right, and I've done plenty
Sometimes I wonder what the lord sent me
Shit
Fulfill your dreams, keep up the schemes
You've got your family you've got your team
Stay on top and learn from what you've seen
Cuz if there's dirt it can always be clean

Cuz the bangs underneath my eyes are lookin' black
Pressure comin' down could result in gettin' slacked
But I gotta stop the demons from gettin' on my back
Night time cruise into daytime
And everybody's hanging where I'm looking for the next line
Throw it all up continue to shine somehow
Next thing now

Let the beats go out
What's happening now
Somehow, someway, next day, what do you say?

The future looks much brighter then those bad yesterdays

The future looks much brighter then those bad yesterdays
Not sayin' it was all bad but tomorrow's another day

I need to make myself a plan
Cuz I don't wanna end up an angry man
Lookin' in my past and thinkin', damn
Forty years old with nothing in my hand
Close your palm it could slip like sand
If you don't respect and understand
What's been put out in front of you
Stop a little while let me? What I'm comin' to
Got some stuff that I don't wanna hand to you
So I'm sittin' in my laugh for a month or two
Payday, Friday, time to wash all your worries away

I regarded the cosmos through a circle of rope
So I threw out my plans, ran on to the wheel
And emptied my head of all childish ideals

The sleep of no feeling
The sleep of no being
The sleep of no dreaming
The sleep of no dreaming

I married the first girl who wasn't a man
And smiled as the spiders ran all over my hands

The sleep of no feeling
The sleep of no being
The sleep of no dreaming
The sleep of no dreaming

Made a good living by dying, it's true
As the world in my TV leaks onto my shoes

Well, jackie jackson was a greedy boy
That's right, he liked to stuff his face
The thing that gave that boy the greatest joy
Was eating far too many cakes
And he ate one, two, three, four
But jackie wanted more
Five, six, seven, eight
Jackie had another plate
And by the time he got to twenty
Anybody woulda thought that he'd had plenty
But he had another eight which
Which makes it twenty-eight
So when he got to twenty-eight
He stopped
He stopped eating cakes but only because he'd run out of cakes
But
Jackie jackson was a greedy boy
Yes, he said, ""i've not had enough
I think that i could eat a thousand cakes
Then i could eat a thousand more
Because
Because i love the taste of tasty cakes
I think i'll find myself some more!""
And he did
He went down to the local shop where there were loads of cakes
Loads of cakes
So he ate one, two, three, four, five and six
Well, jackie was a little bit sick
And didn't stop when he got to eight
And said, ""i love the taste of cakes!
I love the taste of cakes, that's right
I'll eat all day and i'll eat all night""
And one, two, three, four
Jackie had a little bit more
At seventeen he said, ""i need to eat until the shop is clean
And cakes, and all the cakes pass through my mouth
I munch up a banana
I munched up cakes into my large expanding gut
My large expanding gut.""
And he did, he ate 32 cakes in that shop and
Ah, he'd already eaten 28 cakes
28 and 32, that means he'd eaten 60 cakes
And, well, do you think that jackie jackson's had eaten enough cakes?
Well, jackie was a greedy boy
He said, ""i'll never have enough!""
He ate 10, 20, 30, 40
Jackie said he'd never thought he'd
Get to eat so many tasty cakes and ate another 80
Jackie gave a little moan
His stomach gave a little groan
Jackie yelled and cried, ""oh no! I think my belly's overloaded! My belly's overloaded! My belly's overloaded! My belly's overloaded! My belly's overloaded!""
Bang!

He'd eaten over 200!

Fear more fun, more pain, more flesh
More stars, more smiles, more fame, more sex

More lust, more lies, more love

What if God was a her?
Would I treat her the same? Would I still be runnin' game on her?
In what type of ways would I want her?
Would I want her for her mind or her heavenly body?
Couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly
If I was wit' her would I still be wantin' my ex?
The lies, the greed, the weed, the sex
Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check
Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck
Her, I would reflect on the streets of the Chi'
Ride wit' her, 'cause I know for me she'd die
Through good and bad call on her like I'm chirpin' her
Couldn't be jealous 'cause other brothers worship her
Walk this earth for her, glory, I'm grateful
To be in her presence I try to stay faithful

Faithful to the end
Faithful to the end
Faithful to the end
I'd like to be her very best friend

He worked with her, she was his lady's best friend
Even if they don't try some ladies test men
And this was a test that was bigger than him
Some believe its the nature that is given to men
He had a good gig, a wife, a kid, a decent home
One reason or another couldn't find peace at home
She asked, ""Why do men always have to stray?""
He said, ""I'm bad, not as bad as Eric Benet""
""I used to take 'em out to eat but they wasn't really eatin'
Mighta got a little head but I wasn't really cheatin'""
It's hard when your lady don't believe what you say
And what you did in the past you gotta live with today
She asked if they could spend the night together
He thought, and said, ""I'm tryin' to get my life together""
Went home to his lady, these were his confessions
""Baby you a blessin' and my best friend""

Then they smiled with eyes
That looked as if they knew me

In beguile to hurt me
Then the man next door had told
She's been here in tears for fifteen years
This is scaring me, woo

Found that wicked women

Midnight blue

I see the lonely road that leads so far away
I see the distant lights that left behind the day
But what I see is so much more than I can say
And I see you in midnight blue

I see you cryin' now, you've found a lot of pain
And what you're searchin' for can never be the same
But what's the difference 'cause they say what's in a name?
And I see you in midnight blue
(Midnight blue)

I will (I will) love you tonight
And I will (I will) stay by your side
Lovin' you, I'm feelin' midnight blue
(Midnight blue)

I see you standing there far out along the way
I want to touch you, but the night becomes the day
I count the words that I am never gonna say
And I see you in midnight blue

I will (I will) love you tonight
And I will (I will) stay by your side
Lovin' you, I'm feelin' midnight blue
(Midnight blue)
Can't you feel the love that I'm offering you?
Can't you see how it's meant to be?
Can't you hear the words that I'm saying to you?
Can't you believe like I believe?
It's only one and one, it's true
Still I see you in midnight blue
(Midnight blue)

I see (I see) beautiful days
And I feel (I feel) beautiful ways
Of loving you, everything's midnight blue

I will (I will) love you tonight
And I will (I will) stay by your side
Lovin' you, I'm feelin' midnight blue

I will (I will) love you tonight

You can put it down to lack of patience
Put it down to lack of sleep
But it's in my head to stay in bed
Tucked under the sheets

They said if I tried to get on, I'd get on
They said there were chances, but now my chance has gone

[Chorus]
And I know what you think
What you think about me
Thoughts like that sink home;
To you, we're not deep

Ba ba ba-ba ba-ba
Ba ba ba-ba ba-ba
Ba ba ba-ba ba-ba
Ba ba ba-ba ba-ba

[Verse 2]
Now it may be a sad reflection
On the way young people feel
But early Monday morning
Is losing its appeal
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I open my curtains at 7am
Just so you think I'm up with the rest of the men

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You'd do yourself a favour if you gave yourself a break
But that's one risk you'd never take
The evening's yours, the morning's mine
But don't knock me, I'm doing fine

You'd do yourself a favour if you gave yourself a rest
But just for now, you know what's best
Ah, ah!

299,Haley Bonar,Blue Ridge Mountains,relaxed,"I ran from the devil
He was on my back
From the Blue Ridge Mountains
I followed your path
I jumped in the river to cleanse my skin
Well my skin froze again when the snow came down
Still in the dark I cry your name!
Jesus won't save your pain
Jesus won't save your pain

I learned you can't run from the dirt in your past
Mistakes don't disperse through the mountain pass
Some say it was the wind that dragged me down
But I know like a face is what made me drown
Still in the dark I cry your name!
Jesus won't save your pain
Jesus won't save your pain

300,Lene Marlin,Disguise,relaxed,"Have you ever felt some kind of emptiness inside?
You will never measure up to those people you
You must be strong, can't show them that you're weak
Have you ever told someone something
That's far from the truth?
Let them know that you're okay
Just to make them stop
All the wondering, questions they may have

I'm okay, I really am now
Just needed some time, to figure things out
Not telling lies, I'll be honest with you
Still we don't know what's yet to come

Have you ever seen your face
In a mirror? There's a smile
But inside you're just a mess
You feel far from good
Need to hide, 'cause they'd never understand
Have you ever had this wish of being somewhere else?
To let go of your disguise, all your worries too
And from that moment, then you see things clear

I'm okay, I really am now
Just needed some time to figure things out
Not telling lies, I'll be honest with you
Still we don't know what's yet to come
Are you waiting for the day
When your pain will disappear?
When you know that it's not true?
What they say about you
You could not care less about the things
Surrounding you
Ignoring all the voices from the walls

I'm okay, I really am now
Just needed some time to figure things out
Not telling lies, I'll be honest with you
Still we don't know what's yet to come

I'm powerless to change your world
I'm powerless to stop the hurt

But I'll give you my heart
Give you my shoulder

I give you my heart
Give you my shoulder

Wanna run for you
Would it do any good?
If I flew for you
You would still be standing

'Cause I'm part of you
And it's hard not to
Not to know what I can do

I'm trying hard to bring you back to joy

And the dream is lost to you
When you're worried and confused

Come on
Ugh
Come on

[Verse 1]
Although ya try to discredit, ya still never read it
The needle, I'll thread it, radically poetic
Standin' with the fury that they had in '66
And like E-Double ""I'm Mad"", still knee deep in the system's shit
Hoover, he was a body remover
I'll give you a dose but it'll never come close
To the rage built up inside of me
Fist in the air in the land of hypocrisy
Movements come and movements go
Leaders speak, movements cease when their heads are flown
'Cause all these punks got bullets in their heads
Departments of police, (What!) the judges (What!), the feds
Networks at work, keeping people calm
You know they went after King when he spoke out on Vietnam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

[Interlude]
Yeah
Yeah, back in this
[Verse 2]
With poetry my mind I flex
""Flip"" like Wilson, vocals never lackin' that finesse
What do I got to, what do I got to do to wake you up?
To shake you up, to break the structure up?
'Cause blood still flows in the gutter
I'm like taking photos, mad boy kicks open the shutter
Set the groove, then stick and move like I was Cassius
Rep the ""Stutter Step"" then bomb a left upon the fascists
Yeah, several federal men
Who pulled schemes on the dream and put it to an end
You better beware of retribution with mind war
20/20 visions and murals with metaphors
Networks at work, keepin' people calm
Ya know they murdered X and tried to blame it on Islam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

What was the price on his head?

Don't retreat but don't be seen, Let nothing come between
No more lazy days, what rate do they pay?
Here's a knife, carve a life. As we plot your downfall in the nearest aisle
They're nailing up the coffin but you're smiling as you go
Coining in to nothing, it's all part of the freak show
Walk in my shadow
Ritual exclusion is just a part of everything
And tolerance depends upon the song you sing
Who's poison arrow?
And if you dance, you command no more respect
Now we'll have to find some other way to keep the children safe
Eve's been at the drawing board to segregate the human race
Falling from an altercation, you're put in a situation
Denied access to the one thing bound to stop you going under
Now you'll have to face tomorrow with no hope to beg or borrow
Once you count it up you know you're gonna find it's not enough
Your only hope's to cook the books, Pray the man don't choose to look you upEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

For the illness in him
Little knowledge of the non-affection
Between him and his kin

Like a wallflower once blooming
Withered to apparent death
Blaming the guilt
Crying the tears
Torture the pain
Leaving the emptiness behind
Apparently he had no reason
To harbour the trust
He'd forsaken inside
Apparently he left his reasons
Forsaken the trust
That harboured within
Walk, I cannot walk
For I am blind, blinded I am
By the pitch of dark, so dark is it
The narrow street, never ending narrow
Clogs my throat
Silently I try
Try to walk, blinded by the pitch
The narrow darkness, clogs the street
I am speechless
I am speechless
Fear puts a rush on my steps
As I stare into the spinning depth
The end is not near the sight that I am hoping for

Is the wish and will for the end to see

But I'm still in love with you

[Verse 2]
Hide your eyes, hide your tears
Hide your face, my love
Hide your ribbons, hide your bows
Hide your coloured cotton gloves
Hide your trinkets, hide your treasures
Hide your neatly scissored locks
Hide your memories, hide them all
Stuff them in a cardboard box
Or throw them into the street below
Leave them to the wind and the rain and the snow
For you might think I'm crazy
But I'm still in love with you
Call me up, baby, and I will answer your call
Call me up but remember I am no use to you at all
[Verse 3]
Now, you're standing at the top of the stairs
One hand on the banister, a flower in your hair
The other one resting on your hip
Without a solitary care
I fall to sleep in the summer rain
With no single memory of pain
And you might think I'm crazy
But I'm still in love with youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

On a cold December night
It was a Tuesday on a gig

Say your name and I said mine

You've been here on my mind

Please don't go
I love you so
I want to kiss you
I need to kiss you

And I feel the strangest way because
I can't remember my own name
But I do remember yours

For feelings just like this
Will I end up by myself
Or in the perfect kiss

Justification
Can't rid the sexual fascination

You deny
My face of pleasure the gleam in my eye

You're nothing

A subjective mannequin
Beaten into submission
Raping again and again

Shackled
My princess
Dangling in distress
Here
To discipline
My sole purpose never ends
Bleeding
On your knees
My satisfaction is what I need
The urge
To take my fist
And violate every orifice
You're nothing
An object of animation
A subjective mannequin
Beaten into submission
Raping again and again

Scream to your heart's content
Time and time again
Pleasure in inflicting pain
Power so insane
Trying to circumvent
Unadulterated battery
Manipulated reality

I am the emperor of lies, you grovel at my feet

And still you play the sycophant and revel in your pain
And all my promises are lies, all my love is hate
I am the politician and I decide your fate

The lightning flashes thunder claps
Oh is it just a dream Ophelia
Saw the dark clouds rolling
Scavengers revolving as we
Made love on a log in the fog
Is it just a dream Ophelia
There was just a hint of searchlight
It illuminates a pair of lonely souls locked together
Is it just our dream Ophelia
Trying hard to hide
To melt away but rolling for a
Gallery of eyes
Watching waiting
Is it just our dream Ophelia
And love is blind
It cracks its stick across our fingers
Makes us bleed It makes us sick
Is it just our dream Ophelia
Water's boiling but the need is strong
And we have to swim
Let's find an island find a log
That maybe we'll call home
Our home Ophelia
Do you think that we can make it on our own

It's what I asked for, it's what I needed
Well, you know me better than that, or at least you did and something happened
But once again something's happened
The confidence you held in us is the rope we almost hung ourselves with
At times I wonder if we really took the steps to break right through it
I know that there were better days, but to see the light and to feel the rays
Life was always back and forth and we were idling or making useless ruckus

Waiting for the rain to stop
Destination: beautiful
Seems that I'm still waiting for the sun
Someday will come back to us
If you're willing let it go
Why won't you just let this be your sun?
It seems like yesterday we had the world our way
But some say we're headed for destruction

I'll ask you
What in the world should we do?
The light is green our break is through
Are we not trying or are we trying to hard?
Well, you know I never want to miss
I hold on tight and reminisce
But it's bittersweet to me
When time stands still as it's trapped inside the letterbox you gave back to me
But I'm the one who keeps on reading...reading
But I'm the one who wants to let it go
I'm the first to speak

I still get jealous
When they look at you
I may not show it, but I do

It's more than I can bear
When they start to stare

You're too good to be true

I still get jealous
When we kiss goodnight
Unless you hold me
Extra tight

And dear, I know a secret
You didn't know I knew
I still get jealous
'Cause it pleases you

And tell a tale of springtime
Someone will call, hungry to spite me
Absent from luck and blame so slightly

In sight, the tale goes hiding
Reveal a bite, skin tightening
Soon gone the thought, am I distracted

So sad, but yet so rightly
We took the tale so lightly
Snows are so far, and lost stars lightening
To enter scorned and tramples tighteningEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

Tell me of my eyes
Black flash come though my own life
Telling these things

And I believe in you

White flash sees the sky
And it turns its side from you
She won't turn my back
And I know you turn so blue
And you know
And your sky is feeling blue
And your heart
So cold when I'm with you
And you feel
Like no one told you to
And your time is your side
And your time with me
Ah, don't talk to me
Ah, don't talk to me
Don't talk to me

Like no one told you how
But you know
Though the king that howls has howled
But you feel like sentimental
But you don't care
If I just share it in your heart
(heart...)
Hopelessly
So hopelessly
I'm breaking through for you and me
And you don't
Though no one told you to
And you found out
Where you were going, where to
You're through with me
But I know that you will be back
For more

You know
And though no one told you so
And you know, blue sky
Like a harder shade of blue
And you walk
When you want
To let go
Me, I'm the outside, tell me fade away
Drop me down but don't break me
In your sleep

In your sleep, inside
It's in your heart and mine
Whole sea is dark

Loving is on your side walking through
So let me in your heart

So say you're sad above beside

So stay sad above we said

You say go, you live
Go live outside of me

Cold summer, cold summer

Still standing on the hill

Enjoy the metal waves
In which we drown ourselves

Your race is burning the pavement

Welcome to the city

Fitter, happier, more productive
Comfortable (Not drinking too much)
Regular exercise at the gym (Three days a week)
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
At ease
Eating well (No more microwave dinners and saturated fats)
A patient, better driver
A safer car (Baby smiling in back seat)
Sleeping well (No bad dreams)
No paranoia
Careful to all animals (Never washing spiders down the plughole)
Keep in contact with old friends (Enjoy a drink now and then)
Will frequently check credit at (Moral) bank (hole in wall)
Favours for favours
Fond but not in love
Charity standing orders
On Sundays ring road supermarket
(No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants)
Car wash (Also on Sundays)
No longer afraid of the dark
Or midday shadows
Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
Nothing so childish
At a better pace
Slower and more calculated
No chance of escape
Now self-employed
Concerned (But powerless)
An empowered and informed member of society (Pragmatism not idealism)
Will not cry in public
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet (Shot of baby strapped in back seat)
A good memory
Still cries at a good film
Still kisses with saliva
No longer empty and frantic
Like a cat
Tied to a stick
That's driven into
Frozen winter shit (The ability to laugh at weakness)
Calm
Fitter, healthier and more productive

In a cage

Before I go to sleep
I come by, I come by
Just to look at you

That in my own small way
I will try, I will try
To help you through

There'll be blue skies falling
There'll be sad scenes and bad dreams
In a world so uncertain
Through the clouds it's hard to see
I will grab you and lift you
As you hold on tight and sway
We'll go walking
Across the fields of gray

There's a place I can go
When the world gets me down
When nothing, when nothing
Goes quite right it seems
As I look there I know
Fortune smiles on me so
But who knows, no one knows
About tomorrow
There'll be blue skies falling
There'll be sad scenes and bad dreams
In a world so uncertain
Through the clouds it's hard to see
I will grab you and lift you
As you hold on tight and sway
We'll go walking
Across the fields of gray

When I was younger I saw things in black and white
Now all I see is a sad, hazy gray
Sometimes I see a narrow flash of light
Sometimes I look and you show me the way

No matter what else happens
What the future will be
In a world so uncertain
Through the clouds it's hard to see
I will grab you and carry you
Calm your fears if you're afraid

But I've seen Cadillacs sailing

And I was born on the shores of Chesapeake Bay
But Maryland and Virginia have faded away
And I keep thinking tomorrow is coming today
So I am endlessly waiting.""

And the comet is coming between
Me and the girl who could make it all clean
Out there in the shadow of the modern machine
Walks St. Robinson in his Cadillac dream

Carrie's down in her basement all toe shoes and twinned
With the girl in the mirror who spins when she spins
From where you think you'll end up to the state that you're in
Your reflection approaches and then recedes again

Yeah, but the comet is coming between
Me and the girl who could make it all clean
Out there in the shadow of the modern machine
Walks St. Robinson in his Cadillac dream

Well, I have dreamed of a black car that shimmers and drives
Down the length of the evening to the carnival side
In a house where regret is a carousel ride
We are spinning and spinning and spinning and now
There's a hole in the ceiling down through which I fell
And there's a girl in a basement coming out of her shell
And there are people who will say that they knew me so well
I may not go to heaven, I hope you go to hell

Yeah but the comet is coming between
Me and the girl who could make it all clean
Out there in the shadow of a modern machine
Walks St. Robinson in his Cadillac dream

In his dream, St. Robinson in his dream

As you froze that
Morning omen
And you told them
And you warned them
That the sky turned red

Doesn't fall down twice

Come back as the morning light

A colourless demise rises
And the only shelter I used to know
Is gone lost out of sight

Of the wonders
Made of wonders

Venivi dall'atrio del cuore
Portando le chiavi del sole
Domani faremo l'amore
E niente potrà mai cambiare

D'un sogno che come nel mare
Si infrange su nere scogliere
D'un nero che può cancellare

Si dice che il sogno dell'uomo
È far si che il proprio domani
Sia senza calar del Sole
Ma dimmi com'è senz'amare?

If I know, what I know, then no one will watch over you
So someone shouldn’t really tell me what I want to know
I know, I owe, and I know that matters don’t matter as much

You will only be yourself
When you can never be yourself

How long, will we go on with a modern way of letting go
Tell me how long will we go on with the modern way of letting you go?

Papers and the news reports
Casualties of every war
The anchor people keeping score
The weapons now are chemicals
In water and in air above
Circulating envelopes
In powder through the postal routes

The threat of a disease is here
We nipped it once without a cure
It took forever till it stopped
Through mandatory needle shots
They gave us all a little dose
Teach our bodies how to cope
Finally when we had it licked
Some terrorists were back with it

The propaganda's working now
I'm falling for it hook and reel
I'm stocking up on medicine
Buying tape to seal us off in

Endangered species, caged in fright
Shot in cold blood, no chance to fight
The stage is set, now pay the price
An ego boost, don't think twice
Technology, the battle's unfair
You pull the hammer without a care
Squeeze the trigger that makes you man
Pseudo-safari, the hunt is canned

All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinction

Tell the truth, you wouldn't dare
The skin and trophy, oh so rare
Silence speaks louder than words
Ignore the guilt, and take your turn
Liars' anagram is ""lairs""
Man, you were never even there
Killed a few feet from the cages
Point blank, you're so courageous
So courageous...

All are gone, all but one

I'm keeping you so settle in now

My return to wildlife by satellite
By beautiful moon-shining girl
Whether by hard ground or splashdown
We're safely back in the world

My heart's not new
I'm not like you
I've loved and been loved well and badly too
My body's been through everything
I've used and been used
I got over it
There's something that you learn on a tightrope
Just outside the spotlight there's a big net waiting for...

Sharp and open, leave me alone
And sleeping less every night
As the days become heavier and weighted
Waiting in the cold light
A noise, a scream tears my clothes as the figurines tighten
With spiders inside them
And dust on the lips of a vision of hell
I laughed in the mirror for the first time in a year

A hundred other words blind me with your purity
Like an old painted doll in the throes of dance
I think about tomorrow, please let me sleep
As I slip down the window, freshly squashed fly

I can lose myself in Chinese art and American girls
All the time, lose me in the dark, please do it right

My memory in a fire, and someone will listen
At least for a short while

(Ey, homie, what happened)
My whole life flashed before my eyes, man

[Verse 1]
Life...
Niggas used to come and get me
When it was time to disagree with an enemy
Pass the Hennessy it gives me energy
Packed the gat in the small of my back
Where these niggas at, I'll clear the whole pack
Talking shit cause I'm down for my set
I'm a vet, smoking on a wet cigarette
Who these niggas think they are
Wishing on a ghetto star, I represent my tar
I start busting and they scatter like water bugs
Cause these Westside niggas is harder thugs
Enslave us but nothing can save us from sporting Ben Davis
Shootin' at your neighbors
Cause sometimes I feel like a nut
Don’t give a fuck when I open you up
Hot rocks
Fly from the back seat
And busta-ass niggas run like a track meet
And if you caught in the middle
Bleed more than a little (what)
Killer King is the hospital
Feeling numb from the bullets I hum
And when they hit
Black mothers have fits
I don’t give a shit
[Chorus]
Fool I'm a vet you can bet
That I could dance underwater and not get wet
Check it
It's raining bullets and I'm still there
I'm still there

[Verse 2]
My house shoes get wet from the dew on the grass
Up early in the morning taking out the trash
Feeling like a loser, alcohol abuser
Two youngsters roll up on a beach cruiser
One on the pedals, the other on the handle bars
Tryna be ghetto stars
They said, ""are you from the Westside is it so?""
I said, ""hell yeah and who want to know?""
Me
In slow mo’, .44 slugs, face down in the mud
Puddle full of blood
Left for dead, the pain starts to spread
Now I can’t feel my legs
I meet Doctor Who at King Drew medical center
As I enter I.C.U
He said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital
I said I can’t move my legs, he said don’t try to
Now this ain’t the end my friend but you'll probably never walk again
I sit there motionless holding this pain inside contemplating suicide
At night I jerk and jerk
But my dick don’t work it don’t even hurt
Now who'd ever thought a nigga rude as Ice Cube
A'be pissing through a tube
Fool I'm a vet

Fool, I'm a vet you can bet
I can dance underwater and not get wet (check it)

Young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair

[Verse 3]
Fuck a V-A they need G-A
Gang Hospital for a cripple
Now I'm drinking Ripple
Same corner, same hood I'm still there
With bandanas tied to my wheel chair
To all the hood rat hoes I'm fired
They mad cause my tongue get tired
Now everybody want to put they dope on me
Sayin I won't get searched by the LAPD
I'm sittin' in a doorway deuce-five
Depending on that to keep my ass alive
I don’t got bows but my arm's about a one-six
With fucking legs looking like tooth picks
Some times I can’t deal
Got to beg the BG's to roll me up the hill
Put me on the porch
Now I'm on the torch
Smoking cocaine
Just to maintain
Nothing to gain nothing to lose
And last night I couldn’t make it to the bathroom
Feeling like a 2-year-old
You can’t get a sip from the brew I hold
It’s the only friend to a stranger
AKA: handicapped gangbanger
There's a lot in my life I regret becoming a ghetto vet
Fool I'm a Vet

Fool I'm a vet you can bet
That I could dance underwater and not get wet

399,Slayer,Necrophiliac,angry,"[Verse 1]
Mortuaries, dead of night
My body starts to rise
In my mind, the horror lives
To feel death deep inside
Relentless lust of rotting flesh
To thrash the tomb she lies
Heathen whore of Satan's wrath
I spit at your demise

[Bridge 1]
Virgin child, now drained of life
Your soul cannot be free
Not given the chance to rot in Hell

[Verse 2]
Satan's cross points to Hell
The Earth, I must uncover
A passion grows to feast upon
The frozen blood inside her
I feel the urge, the growing need
To fuck the sinful corpse
My task complete, the bitch's soul
Lies raped in demonic lust

[Lead - King]
[Verse 3]
Her stomach bursts, the casket breaks
The seed has taken form
A writhing shape of twisted flesh
The Devil's child is thrown
Hungry for the smell of death
He rules forbidden evil
Vengeance with a frenzied hatred
The bastard now must die

[Bridge]
Lost souls of the dead
Form legions that burst through Hell's gates
Death of one sacrifice
To avenge the raped corpse from the grave
Blood of one mortal man
The fire grows stronger within
Fate of a frenzied lust
Lucifer takes my dark soul

[Outro]
Down to the fiery pits of Hell
Down to the fiery pits of
Hell

402,Sting,Brand New Day,happy,"[Verse 1]
How many of you people out there
Been hurt in some kind of love affair
And how many times do you swear that you'll never love again?
How many lonely, sleepless nights
How many lies, how many fights
And why would you want to put yourself through all that again?
""Love is pain,"" I hear you say
Love has a cruel and bitter way
Of paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain
How could it be that what you need the most
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?
You never want to feel so sad and lost again
One day you could be looking
Through an old book in rainy weather
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together
You could be walking down the street
And who should you chance to meet
But that same old smile that you've been thinking of all day

[Chorus 1]
You can turn the clock to zero, honey
I'll sell the stock, we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock all the way back
I wonder if she'll take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way
Turn the clock to zero, sister
You'll never know how much I missed her
Starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero, boss
The river's wide, we'll swim across
Started up a brand new day
[Verse 2]
It could happen to you - just like it happened to me
There's simply no immunity - there's no guarantee
I say love's such a force - if you find yourself in it
And sometimes no reflection is there
Baby wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute

[Chorus 2]
You can turn the clock to zero, honey
I’ll sell the stock, we’ll spend all the money
We’re starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero, Mac
I begging her to take me back
I’m thinking in a brand new way
Turn the clock to zero, boss
The river’s wide, we’ll swim across
Started up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero, buddy
Don’t wanna be no fuddy-duddy
Started up a brand new day

You’re the sum of my equation
I’m the answer to your question
If you follow my suggestion
We can turn this ship around
We’ll go up instead of down

You’re the flame and I’m the candle
Stand up all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl

Abandonnés tout comme si

Ambition in the back of a black car
In a high building there is so much to do
Going home time, a story on the radio

Something small falls out of your mouth and we laugh
A prayer for something better
A prayer for something better
Please love me
Meet my mother, but the fear takes hold
Creeping up the stairs in the dark
Waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow

[Verse 3]
Stroking your hair as the patriots are shot
Fighting for freedom on the television
Sharing the world with slaughtered pigs
Have we got everything?,
She struggles to get away
The pain and the creeping feeling, a little black haired girl
Waiting for Saturday, the death of her father pushing her
Pushing her white face into the mirror
Aching inside me and turn me 'round
Just like the old days
Just like the old days
Just like the old days
Just like the old days

Caressing an old man and painting a lifeless face
Just a piece of new meat in a clean room
The soldiers close in under a yellow moon
All shadows and deliverance under a black flag
A hundred years of blood, crimson
The ribbon tightens round my throat
I open my mouth and my head bursts open
A sound like a tiger thrashing in the water
Thrashing in the water

Over and over, we die one after the other

Reaching deeply into mine

It seemed as if I knew her well
Then she leaned to me and as we gently kissed
I knew that moment my heart fell

She was here

Now I'm lost in wondering
As if waking suddenly
Was it real or just a dream
Where is she?

Was she really here today?

He got a message saying, you tried to reach him on the phone
He didn't want to answer 'cause he's so afraid
You'd probably tell him just to leave you alone

[Verse 3]
I bet you heard he got another band
They're making money, they're making plans
You feel left out but you need to understand
Word on the street: he's still your man
He's still your man
He's still your man, girl
[Verse 4]
Look out, here comes your rainy day
Now you think you got a good reason to say
Everything that's in your heart, come what may
Even though his might get broken

[Verse 5]
Who's the guilty one when there ain't no judge or jury?
Shadow to the sun, next to the one
Hell ain't got no fury

[Verse 6]
Will the roses the dead keep sending
Repair the heart in need of mending
Will this song have a happy ending?
Only the woman knows, only she knows

[Verse 7]
Two sides to every story
One man's gloom, another man's glory
Sun to his shadow, rose to a thorn
Ain't no fury like a woman scorned

Oh no

Oh no

421,Pulp,The Fear,sad,"This is our ""Music from A Bachelors Den""
The sound of loneliness turned up to ten
A horror soundtrack from a stagnant water-bed
And it sounds just like this

This is the sound of someone losing the plot
Making out that they're okay when they're not
You're gonna like it, but not a lot
And the chorus goes like this

Oh baby, here comes the fear again
The end is near again, oh
A monkey's built a house on your back
You can't get anyone to come in the sack
And here comes another panic attack
Oh, here we go again

So now you know the words to my song
Pretty soon you'll all be singing along
When you're sad, when you're lonely, and it all turns out wrong
When you've got the fear

And when you're no longer searching for beauty or love
Just some kind of life with the edges taken off
When you can't even define what it is that you are frightened of
This song will be here
Oh baby, here comes the fear again
The end is near again, oh
If you ever get that chimp off your back
If you ever find the thing that you lack
Oh, but you know you're only having a laugh
Oh, here we go again
Until the end

But never seen - goodbye suicide

Goodbye suicide
Never thought I'd tell a lie
See you later

To be handsome again
Thou art all deformed, and I feel your pain
What I touch with my hand, I touch with my heart

Kiss the hand that blesses me

My blood runs now fierce

Your geometric progeny
That fit inside you oh so tight
With triangles that feel so right

Then man will know the death of God where wonder was before

A girl entered in so that made it four
I snapped one time then came another five
Add 'em all up and that makes nine
The average age 26.5
Now that's what I call gettin' some pi
Five of the chicks wore six-inch heels
Two of the nine squealed like seals

Calm this tide, tide of sorrow

Wakes and sighs again
Opens up the eyes
Sees the ghost again
Our dying love, it prays in vain to live

And I have lost touch
I shouldn't admit it
But I have
It slipped away while I was distracted
I haven't changed
I swear I haven't changed
How did this happen? I didn't feel myself
Evaporating...

My body has gone
But my eyes remain
Hovering. Witnessing
Cold as a ghost ... watching the streets
Sheltering in doorways of
Venice, Vienna
Budapest, Krakow, and Amsterdam

I have become the invisible man

The invisible heart beating against you
The invisible pulse silently thumping

I shout my name in the public places
No one seems to notice
No one understands
I stand perfectly still
In the middle of the road
I hold my nerve
I hold my nerve
Hold my nerve
But the cars don't swerve
I will hear your prayers
As you whisper alone
I am the one you felt was close
Close behind you in St. Stephen
You lit a candle
Blessings in the cold night air

I'll feel your breath as you turn to go
I'll watch you leave
From somewhere up high
As you cross the park
In the Autumn light
In the Autumn light
In the Autumn light

If I close my eyes
I can see where you live
Climb the winding stairs
Up to your apartment
The scent of you preparing
His evening meal
I must watch in dread
When he's cruel to you
In horrified silence
As you make love
I cannot lift a hand
Lift a hand to stop him
I don't exist What can I do?
What can I do?
I will scream in your ear
As you're passing by
I will wrap my arms around you
You won't hear, you won't feel me
I will walk stride for stride with you
I will try to help
When you stumble
You will stumble through me

I have become the invisible man
It's all I am
Invisible

I have read all your letters
I know what you contain
I have dreamt your dreams
My head..
My head is haunted
I will scream again
""I am perfectly sane""

I feel it in my bones, I feel it in my shoes
I was lost, but now I'm found
And all my troubles are turning around

Oh I feel I've getting so close to you
Heaven's holding my hand
And I'm ready to break on through

So I'm tearing down the walls inside
Letting go of all my pride
Making room for the lie
I don't need to hide inside this shell
This shell no more
No more

I don't know my right from left
And I've been going around this bend
So many miles I have roamed
Lately I feel like I'm coming home

Oh I'm getting so close to you
Heaven's lighting a candle
And I'm ready to break on through

So I'm tearing down the walls inside
Letting go of all my pride
Making room for the lie
I don't need to hide inside this shell
This shell no more
No more
Oh no, no, no, no more, no more
So I'm tearing down the walls inside
Letting go of all my pride
Making room for the lie
I don't need to hide inside this shell

438,Dinosaur Jr.,Not the Same,sad,"[Verse 1]
On this day where you're so messed it's clear
Cannot explain the world you roam
Anyone who has been
As I walk with you, it chills me so
To hear you say it has come to this
And that it is okay

[Verse 2]
In a dream, I always talk to you
You seem fine again, my sweet
Feels alright to me
Is it right for you?
Flipping out I try to call to you
Do you call to me?
Tell me what to do

And I know it is not the same, there is no blame - still I bother you
And you say it is not your deal, it is mine to feel - follow along with you

[Verse 3]
Come alive I know you will sing to me
I would not sing to you
It is not a thing I do
Has it been a different feel for you?
The whole time this was going on
Or is it something new?
And I know it is not the same, there is no blame - still I am bothering you
And you say It is not your deal, it is mine to feel - you would not pull me through
Anyway, you are not the same, it is the blame - follow along with you
[Verse 4]
It is a lingering that comes through me
Does it come to you?
Are we really through?
Any guy would do this thing for me
It is not much to ask
Why cannot you?
I am not going to say I have had my way
You sure saw to that
But what else can I do?
You promised so much that I would never touch
I believed in you

Just pass me by, don't even speak

Tiedän että on yö, kun saavut kotiisi pimeään
Yksinäisyys lyö, sanomatta nimeään
Kun luet kirjeeni kaiun kuulet
Tahrat näet joita sateeksi luulet

[Verse 2]
Kuljen ulkona valossa, kasvoillani voin tuntea tuulen
Ei sitä tuntunut talossa, johon palaa en koskaan, luulen
En ole menossa minnekkään
Ei missään tule minun luokseni, minun vuokseni

[Chorus]
Vain tahroja paperilla, älä siis suutu
Ei niistä asiat miksikään muutu
Ei se että meillä oli retkemme
Eikä se että meillä oli hetkemme
Voi tuuli kylmästi kutittaa selkää
Se eteenpäin työntää, älä siis pelkää
Älä huoli siitä, sillä meillä oli retkemme, aa aa
Muista, että meillä oli hetkemme

[Verse 3]
Kutsun saaneena tulin, lähdin kuin varas, säikähdin viimein
Kun itseeni tarttuneen, tajusin varttuneen
Imin sut kuiviin, tarttui mun huiviin tuoksusi
Teit saman minulle, juoksusi annan anteeksi sinulle
[Chorus]
Vain tahroja paperilla, älä siis suutu
Ei niistä asiat miksikään muutu
Ei se että meillä oli retkemme
Eikä se että meillä oli hetkemme
Voi tuuli kylmästi kutittaa selkää
Se eteenpäin työntää, älä siis pelkää
Älä huoli siitä, sillä meillä oli hetkemme, aa aa

Vain tahroja paperilla, älä siis suutu
Ei niistä asiat miksikään muutu
Ei se että meillä oli retkemme
Eikä se että meillä oli hetkemme
Voi tuuli kylmästi kutittaa selkää

Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me

Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me

Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery

Cannot kill the battery

Clambered to my feet and into the night again
Back to my home, back to my owner
Who screams at my tardiness
Put his hands to the sky

And says, what can I do with a girl
If she refuses to be mine?

In his bed I am queen, unobtainable me
Sexual being, human with feelings
The two are not me
The two will not be mine

And a garden of such beauty that the flowers seem to grin
There's a house across the river, but alas, I cannot swim
I'll live my life regretting that I never jumped in

[Verse 2]
There's a boy across the river with short black curly hair
He wants to be my lover and I want to be his peer
There's a boy across the river but, alas, I cannot swim
And I never will get to put my arms around him

[Verse 3]
There's a life across the river that was meant for me
Instead, I live my life in constant misery
There's a life across the river, but I do not see
Why I should please those who will never be pleased?
[Refrain]
There is gold across the river, but I don't want none
There is gold across the river, but I don't want none
Gold is fleeting, gold is fickle, gold is fun
Gold is fleeting, gold is fickle, gold is fun
There is gold across the river, but I don't want none
I would rather be dry than held up by a golden gun

The sleigh bells are ringing, and the carolers are singing
While the air-raid sirens blare

It's the end of all humanity
No more time for last-minute shopping
It's time to face your final destiny

We can dodge debris while we trim the tree
Underneath the mushroom cloud

Or Jack Frost on your windowsill
But if someone's climbing down your chimney
You better load your gun and shoot to kill

And if the radiation level's okay
I'll go out with you and see all the new
Mutations on New Year's Day

Just seconds left to go
I'll duck and cover with my Yuletide lover
Underneath the mistletoe

You’re going to have to serve somebody
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord
But you’re going to have to serve somebody

You may be a construction worker working on a home
You may be living in a mansion or you might live in a dome
You might own guns and you might even own tanks
You might be somebody’s landlord, you might even own banks

But you’re going to have to serve somebody, yes indeed
You’re going to have to serve somebody
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord
But you’re going to have to serve somebody

[Verse 5]
You may be a preacher with your spiritual pride
You may be a city councilman taking bribes on the side
You may be working in a barbershop
You may know how to cut hair
You may be somebody’s mistress, may be somebody’s heir

[Chorus]
But you’re going to have to serve somebody, yes indeed
You’re going to have to serve somebody
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord
But you’re going to have to serve somebody

Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk

Told my homeboy I was scoping, hoping
To crack them legs wide open
Ready to break that thang in half
Hit it with the shaft
Take a bath and I'm out, yeah
Better keep the Trojan
And if the sex was good, still be the hoe's friend
Fucked around and told my plan to the man
Sitting next to the goddamn man
How was I to know son
That the negro would run and tell the 4-1-1
With a big fat grin
Talking 'bout all the hoes that I ran up in
Broke a nigga' plan like dishes
'Cause now the bitch is getting suspicious
She know I fuck hoes outa habit
Who framed Cube? Mothafuck Roger Rabbit

Into the open arms of the Holy Ghost

I'm running low and the devil is on my trail
When fate delivers me all I'll ask it for
Is a place to rest and shelter for my soul

Oh if I could spend my days
Free from the prison of your gates
Then I could die a happy man

Oh if I could spend my days
Free from the shadow of my name
Then I could die happy man

What floats and has a shape like that
Fans like us who watch the skies
We know it's Morph the Cat

Gliding like a big blue cloud
From Tompkins Square to Upper Broadway
Beyond the Park to Sugar Hill
Stops a minute for latte

He oozes down the heating duct
Swims like seaweed down the hall
He briefly digs your wiggy pad
And seeps out through the wall

It's kind of like an arctic mindbath
Cool and sweet and slightly rough
Liquid light on New York City
Like Christmas without the chintzy stuff

What exactly does he want
This Rabelaisian puff of smoke
To make you feel all warm and cozy
Like you heard a good joke

Like you heard an Arlen tune
Or you bought yourself a crazy hat
Like you had a Mango Cooler
Ooh, Morph the Cat
He's all the talk in shops and schoolyards
Sultan Place, the Automat
Players playin' in da Bronx
Respect to Morph the Cat

Kind of like an arctic mindbath
Cool and sweet and slightly rough
Liquid light on New York City
Christmas without the chintzy stuff

So rich is his charisma
You can almost hear it sing
He skims the roofs
And bells begin to ring

Chinese cashiers can feel it now
Grand old gals at evening mass
Young racketeers
And teenage models
Laughing on the grass

Blessed Yankees have an ally
When this feline comes to bat
Bringing joy to old Manhattan
All watch the skies for Morph the CatEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

To lay down underneath the stars
Listen to Papa's translations
Of the stories across the sky
We drew our own constellations

The west winds often last too long
And when they calm down
Nothing ever feels the same
Sheltered under the Kamani tree
Waiting for the passing rain
Clouds keep moving to uncover the sea
Of stars up above us chasing the day away
To find the stories that we sometimes need
Listen close enough, all else fades
Fades away
It was just another night
With a sunset and a moonrise
Not so far behind
To give us just enough light
To lay down underneath the stars
Listen to all the translations
Of the stories across the sky
We drew our own constellations4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",folk/acoustic

491,Stephen Lynch,Baby,happy,"This is for my little girl

[Verse 1]
My lady gives birth today
I run to her room right away
She smiles with glee, then hands her to me
I look at my newborn and say

[Chorus 1]
Damn that’s a ugly baby
Damn that’s a ugly ass baby
I’m feeling quite concerned, my semen must’ve turned
‘Cause damn that’s an ugly baby

[Verse 2]
I can’t believe this came from me
I think her mom did too much LSD
She’s skinny like a twig
At least her nuts are big
But the placenta is cuter than she

[Chorus 2]
Damn that’s a ugly baby
God Damn that’s a ugly ass baby
I can’t take her home today, she’ll scare the dog away
‘Cause damn that’s a ugly baby
[Verse 3]
And when she smiles I find
Shane McGowan comes to mind
It makes me want to cry
When I look into her good eye
I always wanted kids
Is it wrong to hope for sids?
Fuck you it’s my fucking baby

Then the doctor calls me in
Mr. Lynch she has a twin

[Chorus 3]
Damn that’s a good looking baby
One for two on the good looking babies
I almost start to weep, now this one we can keep
‘Cause that was an ugly ass

[Bridge]
Damn that’s an ugly baby
Damn that’s an ugly ba- SING FUCKERS C’MON
Damn that’s an ugly baby WOOOH
Damn that’s an ugly baby

[Verse 4]
She’s got one good tooth and one ear and one eye
And thank god just one nose but it’s on her left thigh
Now doctor I’m asking you guy to guy
Would a really really really late term abortion still fly
[Outro]
Oh no my baby not me
I don’t want no ugly baby
I said damn that’s an ugly baby
Damn that’s an ugly ass baby

Thank you, good nightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",country

'cause he's got the face of an angel but
There's a devil in his eye!
He's such a delicate thing but when he's starting to squeeze
You'd be surprised
He doesn't look very strong but when you sit on his knee
You'd be surprised
At a party or at a ball
I've got to admit he's nothing at all
But in a Morris chair, you'd be surprised
He doesn't say very much but when he's starting to speak
You'd be surprised
He's not so good at the start but at the end of the week
You'd be surprised
On a streetcar or in a train

I guess I need an amnesiac priest or something
Or a stranger on a long bus journey to somewhere far away
One day the desert will cover all the earth
With only the wind to sing in the silence
All my secrets buried forever in the blown dust

It seems so simple but they just don't get it
I meant what I said at the time that I said it
Nothing is ever meant to last
I want no mirror, I want no shadow
I want my follies to have no echo
Only the ties to hold on fast

Nobody has their consciences clean
Loyalty in the end will be enough
This family thicker than blood
The way we grew together, roots twisted together
And everybody thinks what they shouldn't think
Everybody does what they shouldn't do
Everybody wants what they shouldn't want
Hold on to me and I'll hold on to you

Maybe I'm wrong but they just don't get it
I meant what I said just at the time that I said it
Nothing is ever meant to last
I want no mirror, I want no shadow
I want my follies to have no echo
Only the ties to hold on fast
We spread our mischief with a little glint in the eye
Where there is war we like to bring peace
Where there is peace we want to bring war
Seduce the priests and break it all

Are you ready?

[Verse 1]
If frizzy hair was a metaphor for festival time
Then this woman is a goddess of that festival shrine
Met her at a jam in a garden of sorts
I must confess, god bless, some impure thoughts
""Show us the money"" was the call of the night
But no money could have bought even a piece of the pride
There might have been a sea of people I don't know
Because all I could see was how this woman she glowed so

Why, it's a pleasure to meet you
You look like one incredible creature
Wanna treat you fine, let's dance and grind
Get so funk-inflicted, it's a crime
You're divine you're sublime and well you blow my mind
You're so sly

[Verse 2]
She caterpillar so good that all the Greeks go, ""Killa!""
Break and enter take ya like a glass of milk then (Spill ya)
Saw her coming, what a scene, what I mean she got
That sex coffee bean, but she tastes like vanilla
Well alright, she ignite when we hit the floor
Like the vroom on a super Commodore
Now if it makes a good story, well it's just worthwhile
With her's like dealing stories in a sprinkler style, it's so sly

Everyone quickly hushed up and took a step back as Jennifer rose and stood over the girl, examining her handiwork. Her partner laid motionless beneath her, seemingly dead. Her eye sockets dry and empty, her heels and elbows scraped and bloodied. Some on-lookers gasped in horror, some swooned and fainted melodramatically, most just stared in disbelief. Jennifer reached down between her thighs and pulled the crotch of her bathing suit to the side - exposing her vagina. The other girl slowly sat up and began sliding her fingers into Jennifer. A few minutes later, her wrists were in, then her elbows. Eventually she would completely disappear into her womb. Jennifer tilted her head to the side curiously. She heard the sound of a rickety-wooden roller-coaster in the distance, its passengers screaming in mock terror. She knew that, sooner or later, they would realize that the ride wasn't stopping and they were all going to die1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",metal

This is the new sound, just like the old sound
Just like the noose wound over the new ground
Ain't the new sound just like the old sound?
Look at the noose now, over the, over the, over the burning ground
Ain't it funny how the factory's doors close?
'Round the time that the school doors close?
'Round the time that the doors of the jail cells
Open up to greet you like the reaper?
Ain't it funny how the factory's doors close?
'Round the time that the school doors close?
'Round the time that a hundred thousand jail cells
Open up to greet you like the reaper?

I saw her today, I saw her face
Was the face I loved and I knew
I had to run away
And get down on my knees and pray-ay
That they'd go away
But still they begin...
Needles and pins
Needles and pins
Needles and pins...

[Verse 1]
I heard somebody fixed today
There was no last goodbyes to say
His will to live ran out
I heard somebody turned to dust
Looking back at what he left
A list of plans and photographs
Songs that never will be sung
These are the things he won't get done
The things he won't get done...

[Chorus 1]
I've seen the man use the needle
Seen the needle use the man
I've seen them crawl from the cradle
To the gutter on their hands
They fight a war but it's fatal
It's so hard to understand
I've seen the man use the needle
Seen the needle use the man
[Verse 2]
Just one shot to say goodbye
One last taste to mourn and cry
Scores and shoots, the lights go dim
Just one shot to do him in
He hangs his head and wonders why
Why the monkey only lies, lies, lies...
But pay the pauper, he did choose
He hung his head inside the noose
He hung his head inside the noose, oh...

[Chorus 2]
I've seen the man use the needle
Seen the needle use the man
I've seen them crawl from the cradle
To the coffin on their hands
They fight a war but it's fatal
It's so hard to understand
I've seen the man use the needle
Seen the needle use the man
Cryptic writing on the wall
The beginning of the end
I've seen myself use the needle
Seen the needle in my hand

[Instrumental Break]

I've seen the man use the needle
Seen the needle use the man

Seen the needle in my hand

And he's half in love with you

Some things are too painful to say out loud
Well, they live behind a veil and see through a shroud
Words fly through his mouth, like paper butterflies
They flutter around and burn holes in your side

And he's half in love with Elizabeth
And he's half in love with you

I knew that you were thinking of him last night
Cause I saw the blood seep down to your toes
Turn away if you must
But how can you put your trust
In a man who always sleeps in his clothes?

And he's half in love with Elizabeth
And he's half in love with you
Yes, he's half in love with Elizabeth
And he's half in love with you

You're the sweet scent on an envelope
A folded photo in his purse

I'm afraid the bubble will burst

Silver shadow
Glowing shadow
Shining brightly
For all to see

[Verse 1]
I remember gazing on this quiet night
The stars were bright as they could be
Wonderin' if things would ever go right
And if there was a spot up there for me
Then one star got brighter by the minute
Strange that it seemed to have my name written in it
I reached for the star, and it kissed me with its light
It made me cast a show that was silver and bright

Silver shadow
A glowing shadow
Shining brightly

I never had any real reason
To thank my lucky stars
But now I got a pretty good reason 'cause
I know I'm gonna go so far
I believe in magic, I really do
With all that's happened it's got to be true
I cast a silver shadow from the kiss of the light
I knew that I was destined, starting with tonight

Mother of a soldier
A tree in a forest up in flames
Black valley, peace beneath the city
Where the women hear the washboard rhythm in their bosom when they say
""Give me good legs
And a Japanese car
And show me a road""

Sing a song for the bodies buried by the riverbank
A well-dressed boy
And a pig with a bullet in the brain
Black valley, peace beneath the city
Where the white girls wander the strip mall, singing all day
""Give me a juggernaut heart
And a Japanese car
And someone to free""

Say something for the body buried like a keepsake
Mother of million mouths with the very same name
Black valley, peace beneath the city
Where the women tell the weather
But never ever tell you what they pray
They pray
""Give me a yellow brick road
And a Japanese car
And benevolent change""EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",folk/acoustic

Ayo, I know you ain't talkin' about me, dog
You? What?!)
Fuck Jay Z!
(You been on my dick, nigga
You love my style, nigga)
Fuck Jay Z!
[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Verse 1]
Brace yourself for the main event, y'all impatiently waitin'
It's like an AIDS test, what's the results? Not positive
Who's the best: Pac, Nas and B.I.G.? Ain't no best
East, West, North, South, flossed out, greetings
I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts left, chest/face gone
How could Nas be garbage? Semi-autos at your cartilage
Burner at the side of your dome, come out of my throne!
I got this locked since '91, I am the truest
Name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters, but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music
Check it
[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

Ayo, pass me the weed!
Put my ashes out on these niggas, man
Ayo, you faggots, y'all kneel
And kiss the motherfuckin' ring!

(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Verse 2]
I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave
Talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face
Y'all some well-wishers, friendly-acting, envy-hiding snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef
Started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo
To explode it on a camel and his soldiers
I can handle this for dolo, and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made an album called Blueprint (Dick!)
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
That you better than B.I.G
Dick-suckin' lips, why don't you let the late great veteran live?
[Interlude 2]
I… will… not… lose
God's son across the belly
I prove you lost already
The king is back, where my crown at?
Ill Will, rest in peace!
Let's do it, niggas!

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly

[Verse 3]
Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you, ‘cause you're my brother
You traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child?
Scared to smile? They called you ugly?
Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TECs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I still whip yo' ass, you 36 in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy
Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together: I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all tryna take my spot, fellas?
Feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot ‘cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin' girls now ‘cause of your looks?
Negro, please! (Ha!) You no-mustache-havin'
With whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans, you wack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane
To Irv, to B.I.G. – and Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons! Ha!
R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z – damn, you on Jaz dick!
So little shorty's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gonna come out your fat lips?
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics

527,Stacey Kent,The Ice Hotel,relaxed,"Let's you and me go away to The Ice Hotel
The Caribbean's all booked out
And that's just as well
Once I'd have been much keener
On Barbados and Antigua
But just now I think the Arctic will suit us well
Let's you and me go away
To The Ice Hotel

They've built it all with ice, that's pure and clear
The sofas, the lobby
Even the chandelier
A thermostat guarantees
A steady minus five degrees
What other place could serve our needs so well?
Let's you and me go away
To The Ice Hotel

Romantic places
Like Verona or Paris
They'll always lead you astray
You'd have to be a novice
To ever trust Venice
And those dreamy waterways
And what the tropics can do
I know only too well
So, let's you and me go away
To The Ice Hotel
Heavy clothing at all times
Is the expected norm
Even candlelight at dinner
Is considered too dangerously warm
And when the time comes for us to sleep
We'll spread out our reindeer fleece
And curl up together
On an ice block carved for two
But then in the morning
Provided we've made it through...

We'll step out together
To watch the sun rise over
That vast expanse of cold
And who knows if we're lucky
We may find ourselves talking
Of what the future may hold
This is no whim of the moment
I want you to realize
Let's go away
To that palace made of ice

Let's you and me go away to The Ice Hotel
The Bahamas are all booked out
And that's just as well

For Hawaii or Tahiti
And when we will be
Only time will tell

Is there anyone out there
Willing to try?
Or are we satisfied with just getting by?

[Verse 1]
We've hurt mother nature
Can't you see her she's crying
We've robbed and we've raped her and taken her child

[Chorus]
And oh oh oh can we find a reason?
Just think about it
And oh oh oh can we find a reason
To live another season?

[Verse 2]
We're fighting more battles
Everyday we're alive
We should be rejoicing
But instead we cry
This world's so polluted
You would think we were blind
We poison our children
Before they're defined
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Excuse me for saying
Because I've never been shy
But if we don't stop this
We sho'nuff going die
Yes I hope we can make it
Because this river's run dry
Now our only battle
Will be to survive, hey

530,Ghostface Killah,Mighty Healthy,angry,"[Intro]
My God, so they are killers
I've heard lots of people say once a man's a killer, they just keep on killing and killing
They sort of develop a taste for blood
Yeah, that's right
They kill one man, or kill ten
It's all the same (Yes)
After all, they can only hang you once

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Both hands clusty, chillin' with my man Rusty
Low down, blew off the burner, kinda dusty
The world can't touch Ghost, purple tape, Rae co-host
Monty Hall expo, intellect, you read pro
Son's triflin' fuck, wildflower on the cycle and
Picked up the broom thought I was Michael-in'
West Brighton Pool, now I'm into Iron Duels
Turn nuns to Earths, Whoopi, she at Allah school
Inhale break beats of Hell a-alikes propel parallel
Duracell knot, you flashed a burnt cell
Snap out of Candyland, kids, the old rumor is
Blacks become immune and shit, we never did
Like eating dead birds, trust the pharmacy over herbs
Men marrying men, ill they got the urge, pulsar
Scissor hand wig vanished in the winter, living off land
You god damn right I fuck fans, king me
Check, checkmate, props like the micro chip founder
Neck to neck stock with Bill Gates now
[Bridge: Ghostface Killah]
When we hug these mics we get busy (Busy)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D (G-O-D)
Make you snap your fingers or wiggle (Wiggle)
Scream, shout, laugh or just giggle (Giggle)
Shake that body, party that body
Don't fuck with Ghost, you'll feel sorry
That's word, I'm not the herb
Understand what I'm saying, saying, saying?

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Hit mics like Ted Koppel, rifle expert
Let off the Eiffel, burn a flag in your grass, spiteful
Ringleader set it off, rap Derek Jeter
Culprit, prince of the game, wish you could see us
We lay low, glitter wax full bangles
Priceless ropes, lay around the God, get tangled
Woolly hair, eyes fiery red, feet made of brass
Twelve men following me, it be the God staff
Move, every script's like Miramax
Smashed the big boy, totaled it, Wilshire and Fairfax
Sun beamin', wifey on the beach sipping Zima
Wu 'binos to Latinos, we love Selena
Overnight, God schedules, FedEx
Pretty silhouette, velvet nice, DNA scroll genetics
Too hot to handle, one thought from scrambling the mandolin
Hundred game Wilt Chamberlain, smack 'em, say when
He rollin' up, face wrinkled up, hands is on his nuts
Yo kid, stop fronting on the grounds 'fore you get touched
It's Canada Dry sess with Allah, son
We want rye, we want it so bad we might cry
[Outro]
For every blow, depends on breath control
So it's the first thing you must learn
Fortunately it's easy
You'll soon learn
My God, so they are killers
Killing and killing
They sort of develop a taste for blood
My God, so they are killers

I know what happens when she drinks Patrón
Her closet's missing half the things she bought

Lose an earring in her drink
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall

She might come home in a tablecloth

A bridal shower with Bacardi punch
Jell-O shooters full of Smirnoff
But tequila makes her clothes fall off

Lose an earring in her drink
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall
Drop a contact down the sink

533,Natalie Merchant,Thick As Thieves (2005 Version),sad,"Remember how it all began the apple and the fall of man
The price we pay so the people say
Down the path of shame it led us dare to bite the hand that fed us
Fairy tale the moral end, wheel of fortune never turns again
Never turns again
The worst of it is come and gone in the chaos of millennium
In the falling out of the doomsday crowd
Their last retreat is moving slow, they burn their bridges as they go
The heretic is beautified, teach the Harlot's child to smile
Wracked again by indecision, should we make that small incision?
Testify to the bleeding heart inside
We cart, we scratched, we ran, we slashed and when he opened up at last
Found a cul-de-sac deep and black, smoke and ash
Deep and black, smoke and ash
The wicked King of Parody is kissing all his enemies
On the seventh day of the seventh week
The tyrant's voice is softer now but just for one forgiving hour
Before the rise of his iron fist again, fist again
I've to come tonight, I've come to know the way we are, the way we'll go
And to measure this width of the wide abyss
I come to you in restless sleep where all your dreams turn bittersweet
With voodoo doll philosophies day glow holy trinities
The crooked raft that leaves the shore, ferries drunken souls aboard
Pilgrims march to compostle visions of their Saint in yellow
Follow deep in trance lost in a catatonic dance
Know no future damn the past, blind, warm, ecstatic, safe at lastEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",folk/acoustic

Until we brought Skip O' Pot2mus

Macing Up The Toilet Seat And Pooping In The Sink

Waiting For A Sprinkle Genie To Come And Drink It Up

Some heavy ammunition in your camp
You got some punch, pizzazz, yahoo, and how?
See, all you gotta do is rub that lamp, and I'll say

Can your friends go, ""Abracadabra, let 'er rip""
And then make the sucker disappear?

So, don't 'cha sit there slack-jawed, buggy-eyed

You got a genie for your charge d'affaires
I got a powerful urge to help you out
So what's your wish? I really wanna know
You got a list that's three miles long, no doubt
Well, all you gotta do is rub like so, hey-oh

Couldn't believe in my eyes
You drifted into my life
But marriages, made in Heaven
Can they survive in this life?

Surely it came as no surprise
Love was too hot to handle
Well, I really blew my cool and you
You just blew out the candle

Didn't you just try just another high?
Didn't you sigh as you waved goodbye?
Just another high

Playing with love was another high
Such a crazy high

Lately it seems so empty here
But I suppose, I'm alright
Maybe tomorrow's not so clear
Still I remember that night

Singing to you like this is
My only way to reach you
And though I'm too proud to say it
Oh, how I long too see you

Shattered by dreams, by your goodbye
Scattered my hopes and filled the sky
Desolate am I

And shame never crept close to our naked feet

Bury my dreams, dig up my sorrows

Nor enlightened by the lessons of Christ
I'll never understand the meaning of the right
Ignorance lead me into the light

Needed elsewhere
To remind us of the shortness of our time
Tears laid for them
Tears of love, tears of fear
Bury my dreams, dig up my sorrows
Oh Lord why
The angels fall first?
Sing me a song
Of your beauty
Of your kingdom
Let the melodies of your harps
Caress those whom we still need

Yesterday we shook hands
My friend
Today a moonbeam lightens my path
My guardianEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",metal
545,Propaganda,Wound In My Heart,relaxed,"You've been just an early entry in my diary
Another page I had to fill
Inside a book of a thousand
I turn the page but my heart it aches
Living my life without you
It seems like something is missing
Something is missing without you
I close my eyes and remember why
So much is missing without you

But when I start to write again

There's a gap in my life
That's too large to fill
A wound in my heart
That no doctor can heal
There's a ghost in my mind
Who is haunting all night
There is trust deep inside
Brings you back to my side
Myself deceiving

You've been another colour
To the picture I'm painting
From the memory I have of you
But all the colours turn into blue
What you see is a part of me
Living my life without you
It seems like something is missing
Something is missing without you
But when I start to write again

It seems like something is missing
Something is missing without you
I close my eyes but I must be blind
So much is missing without you

Life goes on
I will be strong
Living my life without you
But once in a while I realise
That so much is missing
Without you

There's a gap in my life
That's too large to fill
A wound in my heart
That no doctor can heal
There's a ghost in my mind

546,Suburban Kids With Biblical Names,Seems To Be on My Mind,happy,"[Verse 1]
Lost track of what I had to get done
Not meeting anyone
Stuck in one place while the snowflakes all come down
Oh, they're coming down
Yeah, they're coming down now
Poke fun at my incompetence
Doesn't make that much sense
My qualification shrinks as I'm getting old
As I'm getting old
As I'm getting older
All the while

Love seems to be on my mind
Seems to be all the time
This is the way I always start my songs
Singing and swinging along
Singing and swinging along

[Verse 2]
Oh no, that anonymous feeling is true
So vague and pale, that blue
Spending all my quality time with the T.V
Is the last thing I should do
It's the last thing I should do
So long for respectable thoughts
I roam
Plus forty-four long distance call
Making me wish I was not here at home
Now tell me all about Rome
Tell me all about Rome
[Bridge]
Love seems to be on my mind
Seems to be all the time
Oh what a lovely way to spend your life
Not needing anything
Just walk around and sing

[Verse 3]
I took a train
I took a plane
I had to get out of this place
And find my love
Where had she gone?
She was lost in all this stress
Why must I work when I can just travel the world and have fun?
I'm a young boy with a lot of things on my mind

[Chorus]
Love seems to be on my mind
Seems to be all the time
This is the way I always end my songs

547,Celtic Woman,The Wexford Carol,relaxed,"Good people all, this Christmas-time
Consider well and bear in mind
What our good God for us has done
In sending His beloved Son
With Mary holy we should pray
To God with love this Christmas Day:
In Bethlehem upon that morn
There was a blessed Messiah born

Near Bethlehem did shepherds keep
Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep;
To whom God's angels did appear
Which put the shepherds in great fear
""Arise and go,"" the angels said
""To Bethlehem, be not afraid;
For there you'll find, this happy morn
A princely Babe, sweet Jesus born.""

With thankful heart and joyful mind
The shepherds went the Babe to find
And as God's angel had foretold
They did our Saviour Christ behold
Within a manger He was laid
And by his side the Virgin Maid
As long foretold upon that morn
There was a blessed Messiah bornEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",world/traditional

To see a little bit clearer

Who salutes, but no one ever does

Change for you

Do my best to follow through
Come up with a master plan
A homerun hit, a winning stand
A guarantee and not a promise
That I'll never let your love
Slip from my hands

Then you will have them
If it's the mountains' bending rivers

On the verge of a world profound
Standing on unstable ground
Adding insult to irony

""There's no stopping what can't be stopped... no killing what can't be killed...""
There's something' out there waiting for us (Hahaha!)
There's something' out there waiting for us (Hahaha!)

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
You can run but you can't hide
From the Westside night stalker, shit talker
Run and tell them it's the L.M
Nigga with the gat, and I'm back
Off the everyday prey that I slay
Rolling with a fo', chase ya through South Central
Monkey-wrench ho should know that, she'll get the bozack
'Cause I'm not starving, but fuck that Johnny Carson ho
Never had me on the Late Night Show
Coming with the shit that'll hit
""Steady Mobbin'"" 'cause the flavor's good
There goes the neighborhood
Nigga with the third album; how come he don't fall off?
Rolling with the sawed-off gauge
Turn the page of the chapter, caught up in the rapture
But you know Anita, she can get the peter
Eat 'em up, yum, and you're floored
Motherfuck Billboard and the editor; here comes the Predator!

[Hook: Das EFX & Sonny Landham]
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back (There's something' out there waiting for us)
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back (There's something' out there waiting for us)

Check your head for the new style
Fuck Laurence Powell and Briseno, Wind and Koon, pretty soon
We'll fuck them like they fucked us and won't kiss 'em
Riots ain't nothing but diets for the system
Fighting with the beast, no justice, no peace
If any, even if we fuck up Denny
Niggas are sick of your white man tricks with no treat
That's right; now it's on, on sight
You call me a Muslim, no, I'm not a resident
Still got my vote in—Farrakhan for president
Of white America, I'm tearing ya a new asshole
Who's the nigga with the new black
Strolling to your suburb house and I douse
With gas, now who's cleaning up trash?
Eat 'em up, yum, and you're floored
Motherfuck Billboard and the editor; here comes the Predator!

Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Got my black rag showing, and I'm hoin'; Ira Reiner
Can kiss my grits like Flo, on ""Mel's Diner""
I'm meaner than a motherfucking hyena chasing antelope
Put my chrome to your dome, watch it bust like a cantaloupe
I can't stand a rope, so don't try to hang 'em
Talk about dogs; boy, I can slang 'em!
Rat-a-tat-tat on your noggin
'Cause Ice'll cream your ass like Häagen-Dazs
Chocolate, I get crazy when I catch wreck
Even be flipping the tongue like da-diggity-dung Das-EFX
So who is Ice Cube? I'm a rapper, actor, macker
Got a little problem with the redneck cracker, did the tallywacker
Jerry Heller is a devil shit-packer
Coming with a crazy pitch
And the Statue of Liberty ain't nothing but a lazy bitch!
Don't wanna give up the crack, to the black
But you'll call it racial, if we go and rape the hoe
But eat 'em up, yum, and you're floored
Motherfuck Billboard and the editor; I am the Predator!

Far from depths where secrets lie
Maybe in another lifetime

Held my breath but that moment's gone
First time I felt life somewhat hurts
I need an option, a reason and some hope

And I might fall

We all share the pain of our histories
But the ache goes away, if you could see
This night under stars, well I call it peace
If you say, ""I'll never need more than this""

And the trees grow so thick
You can barely see through
And the forest bestows
All the simplest of truths

And you think you'll be happy
If granted one more wish
But the truth is, you'll never need more
You'll never need more, you'll never need more than this

Want so much in this life, there's so much to be
And we sail through our youth so impatiently
Until we see

That the years move along
And soldiers and heroes come home
And they carry a song

Don't live in forgotten times
May this always remind
You of the sea under the skies
Blue looking glass

Let's make this our story
Let's live in the glory
Time, it fades away precious as a song
'Cause someday we'll be gone

Cradling stones hold fire bright
As we watch the glow of the morning light
Someday our bones here they will lie
And so we sing

564,The Puppini Sisters,Soho Nights,happy,"Soho nights were my favourite
They were the nights, so full of flavour
Fun was free, and talk was cheap
Drinks were dirty like the streets!

Soho nights were when you'd find
Those who would seem so out of their minds
Make-believing they were stars
Dragging at criss-crossing bars

Soho, so long! We've had our fun
Soho! So you, not me my love
Soho, so there
So now we're done

You remember when we would play
Life with you was a beautiful game
Soho! So long!
You remember when we would play
Life with you was a beautiful game
Soho! So long!

Soho nights were the times we
Reveled in each other's company
We danced like fools and acted like queens
Among the type with some red jeans
Soho nights were thrilling rides
The more fun we had, the more makeup would slide
The more the makeup would slide I'd see
Soho really wasn't for me

Soho, so long! We've had our fun
Soho! So you, not me my love

You remember when we would play
Life with you was a beautiful game
Soho! So long

Soho nights were so black and white
The color came throughout the night
The more we took, like everyone else
The more alive the both of us felt
Soho nights opened my eyes
I've become a hag by your side
I thought we'd last, but I was wrong
Soho boys don't keep ties for long

Soho, so long! We've had our fun
Soho! So you, not me my love

The ground grown too hard with the years
Falling down was not what it used to be
The ground grown too hard with the years

He told his children those little white lies
The truth would only paralyze them
He told himself those little white lies
The truth would only paralyze him

Lay it down, lay it down

He sold most of what he cherished
The rest he let them steal
Shot his dog out in the open field
The rest he let them steal

He broke all of his promises
Under a sea green sky
They never thought to ask him why
Under a sea green sky

Lay it down, lay it down

Please bury me in the cottonwood trees

Going to sleep tonight in a warm feather bed

And I'm a bad boy like Martin and Will
Show you what you been missin, like the kids on a carton of milk
Hey, I can snatch somethin bad out of the hood
And bring 'em back to the pad out by the woods
You know the crew bring the bad out of the good
And I'm usually not layin in the boozy spots
Girl we can blow quicker than uzi shots
Chill where the Cristal's cold, jacuzzi's hot, ya feel?

I ain't really the kind of girl that, who would
Say that I'm a bad girl, though I should
So many times I did what I thought was, right
But ended up in pain and that's why I'm like this
I still believe and I'm hopin
That I will find real love
But right now it's not the time for, that
Cause I'm young and I'm bad and I like, that

How, how can it be that a love
Carved out of caring, fashioned by fate
Could suffer so hard
From the games played once too often?
But making mistakes
Is a part of life's imperfections
Born of the years
Is it so wrong to be human after all?

Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth

[Chorus]
That there is something about you
Baby so right
I wouldn't be without you baby tonight

If ever our love was concealed
No one can say that we didn't feel
A million things
And a perfect dream of life
Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together
If not so in love
It's not so wrong
We're only human after all
[Pre-Chorus]
These changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh and you need to hear
The time that told the truth

If I could see me smile again

I still reach for the stars, but all I touch is my horizon
I still believe my ears, but all I hear is lasting silence
Like a disciple of a witness
I judge upon my sacred eye
Still I found the origin
In what's left of me inside
Can I call this my burden
Or is this just my dream to fly?
I would be crying tears of laughter
If I could see me smile again
Weaker, weaker every day
I forgot my urge to fly away
And is my life as bare as it is?
Cold and lonely enough?
Have you achieved what you were longing for?
Sad enough this cannot be undone
I drop my eyes and shiver as I see
The reflection in the mirror of me
Have you given up, my friend?
Forgiveness be mine

In summer the bushfires rage and rage
And rage on such beautiful days
And we fight them with water that runs through the cracks
Water we're desperately trying to save
So I'll just live on wine and water my vines
And sleep on the wind with the fires right behind
And sing on the beaches and swim through the night
Oh we'll cry, ""Pass the wine, pass the wine, pass the wine""

The cats are out to play, to play
That old rusty spaceship wants to sail
Into the milky way again
On a river of red, red wine

Grab your bucket, grab your spade

Two o'clock in the arvo, but hey that's allowed

Wait till their judgment day comes, yeah!

Now, in darkness, world stops turning
Ashes where their bodies burning

Begging mercies for their sins

I could call to you
Or I could simply shut you out
No more would you cry, cry, cry

I give you my time to kill
But you'll never never break my will
Or I could sink a sleeping pill
And in the morning could be sleeping still
But most of you are much too ill
Oh, way beyond a surgeon's skill
In bondage to a dollar bill
What more can you buy, buy, buy-uy-uy

Crushing all the creatures great and small
I'd like to see this giant fall
When will it come?
When will it come?
Words that rattle 'round my head
Struck by lightning, someone said
Diamond bullet through the head
Right in the brain
Are they right in the brain?
Are they right in the brain?
Are they right in the brain?

Will I see the jailer's face?
Did my mother lead me to this place?
Or will I live to see his face?
Will another come to take my place in total isolation?
Surrounded by fears
Too many clowns, too many tears
Isolation, surrounded by crowds
In another world, head in the clouds
I'm alive in here, I scream
But you still can't hear
I'm alive in here
I'm alive, turn on the light

603,Anthony Hamilton,I Tried,relaxed,"[Chorus]
Tried for so long
For you to hold on
But you won't be long to anyone
Anything, any love at all

[Verse 1]
I thought we had it all until things started to recede
Giving me no love at all not caring enough about my needs
Gave you my heart and all my soul but not once did I let go
And I tried to stick by you and I tried to call to let you know
That I'm here for you and I'm give my all

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You had the best love of you life
But you didn't treat it right, no you didn't, no you didn't girl
To busy running out all night long, didn't even have the decency to pick up the telephone
And call me, and let me know where you were
And that your alright, so I could sleep at night
Girl you showed out so
Had the nerve to break up our happy home
All I wanted to do for was let you know

[Chorus]
[Bridge]
I stood by your side, sheltered for you
When things were down, I help pull you through
Faithful and all, trusting and warm
But you took heart by storm

My lines are short, I'll fix you up
So won't you please come on

When the beat comes on, the girls all line up
And the boys all look, but no, they can't touch
But the girls want to know why boys like us so much
They like way we dance, they like the way we work
They like the way that L.A.M.B. is going 'cross my shirt
They like the way my pants, it compliments my shape (She's crazy, right?)
They like the way we react every time we hear the...

You've got to let the beat get under your skin
You've got to open up and let it all in
But see, once it gets in, the popping begins
Then you find out why all the boys stare
See, they're trying to bite our style
Trying to study our approach
They like the way we do it, so original
I guess that they are slow, so they should leave the room
This beat is for the clubs and cars that go

Every time the bass bangs, realize it calls your name
Let the beat wind you up, and don't stop 'til your time is up

Bread crumbs in a line when you are lost

Little little seeds grew into troubled trees
A sorry sorry sight between my ears
I need to settle down and eat my troubled fruit
The sweetness of the taste will do me good

In demon days, it's cold inside
You don't get nobody, people sigh
It's so bad, lasting far, but love yourself
Hiding in a hole in there
All the glasses are far too big
Bring it back, got to hold it back
To let you do that, yet you don't want me back
Before it fall down, falling down, falling down
Falling down to go far from the sun
[Verse 2: The London Community Gospel Choir]
In these demon days, we're so cold inside
It's so hard for a good soul to survive
You can't even trust the air you breathe
'Cause Mother Earth want us all to leave
When lies become reality
Numb yourself with drugs and TV
Pick yourself up, it's a brand new day
So turn yourself 'round
Don't burn yourself, turn yourself
Turn yourself around to the sun
In these demon days, we're so cold inside
It's so hard for a good soul to survive

Reverend, Reverend, is this some conspiracy?
Crucified for no sins, an image beneath me
What's within our plans for life, it all seems so unreal
I'm a man cut in half in this world left in my misery

[Verse 1]
The Reverend he turned to me without a tear in his eyes
Nothing new for him to see, I didn't ask him why
I will remember the love our souls had sworn to make
Now I watch the falling rain, all my mind can see now is your

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I guess you took my youth and gave it all away
Like the birth of a new-found joy, this love would end in rage
And when she died, I couldn't cry, the pride within my soul
You left me incomplete, all alone as the memories now unfold

[Chorus]
Believe the word, I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates

[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder aloud
If you're watching over me, some place far abound
I must reverse my life, I can't live in the past
Then set my soul free, belong to me at last
[Pre-Chorus]
Through all those complex years, I thought I was alone
I didn't care to look around and make this world my own
And when she died, I should have cried and spared myself some pain
You left me incomplete, all alone as the memories still remain

And my concern is now in vain

In our hearts we knew better
And we told ourselves it didn't matter
And we chose to continue
And none of that matters anymore
In the hour of our twilight
And soon it will be all said and done
And we will all be back together, as one
If we will continue at all

[Chorus]
Shame on us, doomed from the start
May god have mercy on our dirty little hearts
Shame on us for all we have done
And all we ever were, just zeroes and ones
[Verse 2]
And you never get away
And you never get to take the easy way
And all of this is a consequence
Brought on by our own hand
If you believe in that sort of thing
And did you ever really find
When you closed your eyes
Any place that was still
And at peace?
And I guess I just wanted to tell you
As the light starts to fade
That you are the reason
That I am not afraid
And I guess I just wanted to mention
As the heavens will fall
We will be together soon, if we
Will be anything at all

[Chorus]
Shame on us, doomed from the start
May god have mercy on our dirty little hearts
Shame on us for all we have done
And all we ever were, just zeroes and ones
Shame on us (shame on us), doomed from the start
May god have mercy on our dirty little hearts
Shame on us for all we have done (shame on us)
And all we ever were just, (just) zeroes and ones1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",metal

How can I tell him I love him
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day when he walks to the sea
He looks straight ahead not at me

Ah, se ela soubesse

The fragrance that she leaves hangs in the air
Soft like a whisper, she's calling me to her
These eyes have seen the most beautiful dream

We found each other, staring at the waves
Started talkin', I couldn't break away
And made plans to meet tonight
Down by the pier, when midnight strikes I'm going to hold that dream near

She moves like sea breeze, swirling around me
The fragrance that she leaves hangs in the air
Soft like a whisper, she's calling me to her
These eyes have seen the most beautiful dream

To my surprise oh
She took my heart with one look in her eye
To a place that feels like home
She moves like sea breeze, swirling around me

Soft like a whisper, she's calling me to her

639,The Rolling Stones,Tie You Up (The Pain of Love),angry,"[Verse 1]
You're deaf to it, blind to it
It's like a thunderclap
Feel the prickles running
Up and down your back
Why so divine, the pain of love
You have to work at it, stay with it
Pay for it, bust your ass
Lie about it, cheat for it
Forget about your past

[Chorus]
Why so divine, the pain of love?
You dream of it passionate
You get a rise from it

[Bridge]
Feel the hot cum
Dripping on your thighs from it
Why why so divine, the pain of love
Sometimes you crave for it, cry for it
Women will die for it

[Verse 2]
Looking back, cut the crap
Was it really worth the rap?
It's hard to survive the pain of love
Ooh I need a time out
Time to make my mind up
Substitute a line out
I'll be back next season with a bang
No release from the jail
No parole, no bail
Hard labor, fifty lashes
Hard labor, money splashes
It's hard to survive the pain of love
The old maid is roughed up
Applying final touches
Even though she's late for the dance
I am telling you tonight she's really got to have a ball
[Bridge]
She's got to really tie me up
She's got to really tie me up
She's got to really tie me up
She's got to really tie me up
She's got to really tie me up
She's got to really tie me up

[Chorus]
Why so divine, the pain of love?
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Why so divine, the pain of love?
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Why so divine, the pain of love?
That's what they call it: the pain of love
Tie me up, tie me up, tie me up, tie me up

[Outro]
Why so divine, the pain of love?
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Why so divine, the pain of love?
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Why so divine, the pain of love?
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Why so divine, the pain of love?
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Why so divine, the pain of love?

640,Tim Buckley,The Earth is Broken,sad,"Oh now my brother's been taken away
Gone are the old times when we used to say
Oh a woman was younger she knew what to do
Oh but I look around me, now that's not so

I'm lost on that open road no peace do I find
Maybe the wind'll blow a melody and ease my mind

But soon love is broken, they'll take you away
Oh the wars they been growing as no relief
And the old men who ruled them oh they're just like thieves
They rob from the sunshine, oh the air ain't so clean
Our rivers are dirty where once we could see

A smile from your lady friend looking down
Look at that river hey did you ever shiver
Well the earth is broken there is no one to save

I remember quite freely only yesterday
Ah the letter that I read from you read this way
Take care lonesome Timmy, ah don't you start
Thinking you're the only one year that's gone
Out on your lonesome road hey lend a hand to your friend
Yes he's just as lonely and the wind keeps you cold

Remember the rivers that once did flow clean
Ah sometimes I wonder how this old world keeps spinning 'round
All the old folks have gone west, Lord preparing to die
All except for a few of us hangers on
Living each day with trivial hearts

We just stop once in a while cry over the news
In some foreign far city your brother's shot down

Because there was a reason a gun had a hand
And the old man killed youth, squeezed down its hope
Now I'm just waiting brother waiting for the land
Soon in my country there won't be a friend
Each one is trying so hard to defend
That one one last heartbeat before he's tugged away

Lost in the mechanized efficient world logical skies

Ah but no song was written on without a tear in your eyes
Are we the last ones, the last ones to tryEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

If we catch a criminal
When we catch a criminal
There's nothing we can do
But play cops and robbers, cops and robbers

[Verse 1]
We want a revolution and we're baying for your blood
We're laying down the law and your name's mud

You want to be a good boy, but you couldn't stand the taste

642,Jane Monheit,Detour Ahead,relaxed,"Smooth road, clear day
Why am I the only onetraveling this way
How strange the road to love should be so easy
Can there be a detour ahead

Wake up, slow down
Before you crash and break your heart gullable clown
You fool you're heading in the wrong direction
Can't you see the detour ahead

The farther you travel
The harder to unravel
The web he spins around you
Turn back while there's time
Can't you see the dangerous signs
Sot shoulders surround you

Smooth road clear night
Oh lucky me that suddenly I saw the light
I'm heading back away from all this trouble
Smooth road, smooth road

Here right now, you're so demanding
Tell me what you want from me
Concluding, concentrating on my music, lover, and my babies
Make me wanna ask a lady for a ticket outta town

[Hook]
So can I get a window seat?
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a ticket outta town
A look around and a safe touch down

A chance to cry, and a long bye-bye

[Outro]
They play it safe, are quick to assassinate what they do not understand. They move in packs ingesting more and more fear with every act of hate on one another. They feel most comfortable in groups, less guilt to swallow. They are us. This is what we have become. Afraid to respect the individual. A single person within a circumstance can move one to change. To love herself. To evolve10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",r&b
644,Mobb Deep,Survival of the Fittest,angry,"[Intro: Prodigy]
Yeah, sendin' this one out
To my man, Killer B
No doubt indeed
Where that weed?
Nomsayin'?
That old real shit

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
There's a war goin' on outside no man is safe from
You could run, but you can't hide forever
From these streets that we done took
You walkin' with your head down, scared to look
You shook, ‘cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
It's similar to Vietnam
Now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cops' control
They better have the riot gear ready
Tryin' to bag me and get rocked steady
By the MAC one-double, I touch you
And leave you with not much to go home with
My skin is thick, ‘cause I be up in the mix of action
If I'm not at home, puffin' lye, relaxin'
New York got a nigga depressed
So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
God bless my soul
Before I put my foot down and begin to stroll
Into the drama I built
And all unfinished beef, you will soon be killed
Put us together, it's like mixin' vodka and milk
I'm goin out blastin', takin' my enemies with me
And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
Lord, forgive me
The Hennessy got me not knowin' how to act
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
Or maybe it's the words from my man Killa Black
That I can't say so it's left a untold fact
Until my death, my goal's to stay alive
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
[Chorus: Havoc]
Yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(Thug life, we still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

[Verse 2: Havoc]
I'm trapped, in between two worlds, tryin' to get dough
Y'know, when the dough get low the jewels go
But never that, as long as fiends smoke crack
I'll be on the block hustlin', countin' my stacks
No doubt, watchin' my back and proceed with caution
Five-oh lurkin', no time to get lost in the system
Niggas usin' fake names to get out quick
My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
I live a world where squads hit the block hard
Ask my man Twin when he got bagged
That fucked me up, God, but shit happens for a reason
You find out who's your true peoples
When you're upstate bleedin'
You can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you
Hit with a two to four is difficult
Wild on the streets, I try to maintain
Tight with my loot, ‘cause hoes like to run game
Some niggas like to trick, but I ain't with that trickin' shit
I'm like a Jew, savin' dough so I can big whip
Pushin' a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get
I'm stayin' in the projects forever
Jakes on the blocks we out-clever
If beef, we never separate and pull together
When worse comes to worst, my peoples come first
Try to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt
My crew's all about loot—fuck lookin' cute!
I'm strictly Timb boots and Army certified suits
Puffin L's, laid back, enjoyin' the smell
In the Bridge, gettin' down, it ain't hard to tell
You better realize
[Chorus: Mobb Deep]
Yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(Thug life, we still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die

648,Dolly Parton,9 To 5,happy,"[Verse 1]
Tumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawnin' and stretchin' and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the streets, the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

[Chorus]
Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmmm...

[Verse 2]
They let you dream just to watch them shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waiting for the day your ship will come in
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way
[Chorus]
Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life putting money in his wallet
9 to 5, what a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it don't you

650,Shirley Horn,A Time For Love,relaxed,"Paroles de la chanson A Time For Love :
A time for summer skies
For hummingbirds and butterflies
For tender words that harmonize with love

A time for climbing hills
For leaning out of windowsills
Admiring daffodils above

A time for holding hands together
A time for rainbow coloured weather
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of

As time goes drifting by
The willow bends and so do I
But all my friends whatever skies above

I know a time for spring
A time for fall
But best of all
A time for love

A time for holding hands together
A time for rainbow coloured weather
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of
As time goes drifting by
The willow bends and so do I
But all my friends whatever skies above

Of the United States of America
And to the republic for which it stands (People)
One nation, under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice for all (It feels so good to be back)
(Mosh with me now)

[Verse 1]
Scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize, and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it as ""I'ma whip someone's ass""
And if you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multitaskin'
And juggling both, perhaps mastered his craft slash
Entrepreneur who's helped launch a few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career, typical manure, movin' past that
Mr. Kiss-His-Ass-Crack, he's a class act
Rubber Band Man, yeah, he just snaps back

Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog

We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

All the people up top, on the side and the middle
Come together, let's all form and swarm just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people, some white and some black
Don't matter what color, all that matters we're gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
If it rains, let it rain, yeah, the wetter, the better
They ain't gon' stop us, they can't, we're stronger now more than ever
They tell us no, we say yeah, They tell us stop, we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let 'em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush, fuck Bush
Until they bring our troops home, come on, just

Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong

To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

Imagine it pourin', just rainin' down on us
Moshpits outside the Oval Office
Someone's tryna tell us somethin', maybe this is God just
Sayin' we're responsible for this monster, this coward
That we have empowered, this is Bin Laden
Look at his head noddin'
How could we allow somethin' like this without pumpin' our fists?
Now this is our final hour
Let me be the voice and your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times it, and multiply it by six
'Teen million people all equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al-Qaeda through my speech
Let the president answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an AK-47, let him go
Fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil
We got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare
To trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizin' a hero
Look in his eyes, it's all lies
The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out, and wiped
And replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight, you'll know why
'Cause I told you to fight

So come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong

And as we proceed
To mosh through this desert storm
And these closing statements
If they should argue, let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this weapon of mass destruction
That we call our president for the present
And mosh for the future of our next generation

Will this make our lives much better?

What if God was a her?
Would I treat her the same? Would I still be runnin' game on her?
In what type of ways would I want her?
Would I want her for her mind or her heavenly body?
Couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly
If I was wit' her would I still be wantin' my ex?
The lies, the greed, the weed, the sex
Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check
Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck
Her, I would reflect on the streets of the Chi'
Ride wit' her, 'cause I know for me she'd die
Through good and bad call on her like I'm chirpin' her
Couldn't be jealous 'cause other brothers worship her
Walk this earth for her, glory, I'm grateful
To be in her presence I try to stay faithful

One reason or another couldn't find peace at home
She asked, ""Why do men always have to stray?""
He said, ""I'm bad, not as bad as Eric Benet""
""I used to take 'em out to eat but they wasn't really eatin'
Mighta got a little head but I wasn't really cheatin'""
It's hard when your lady don't believe what you say
And what you did in the past you gotta live with today
She asked if they could spend the night together
He thought, and said, ""I'm tryin' to get my life together""
Went home to his lady, these were his confessions

661,The Coral,She's Got A Reason,relaxed,"[Verse 1]
She watched the sky as it bathes into black
Watched with the lovers that never came back
The princes and kings, all the beautiful things and more

She won't wait, she'll never look back
Through the morgue where the mirrors have crashed
She slides through a dream with all her beautiful schemes and more

[Chorus]
She's got a reason to roam with the stars
Watch her go as she sings
Dum dum dara ra ra, dum dum dara ra ra
Dum dum dara ra ra, dum dum dara

[Verse 2]
Love is gold, time is a thief
She's the river that runs to the sea
With her arms open wide, a sorrowful smile and more

Still she wonders soaked to the bone
The road she's on, well, it won't lead her home
To the place she cried for the stranger inside and more

[Chorus]
She's got a reason to roam with the stars
Watch her go as she sings
Dum dum dara ra ra, dum dum dara ra ra
Dum dum dara ra ra, dum dum dara
[Bridge]
She watched the sky as it bathes into black
Watched with the lovers that never came back

Life got tricks but its treats too
Blow my ass on the streets
Yo I see you

You lifted me
So I lifted you
Continue this beautiful cycle

History always tries to enlight you
How much been decided for you
You don't know
So just go
As far as you can go
But go slow

Hey yo

Know this i've noticed
What it is about all this
Seperating real from the fake and bogus
Sitting at the dock of the bay like Otis
We just slide,through this thing called life
Everything gon’ be alright
As you stay true to the path that’s inside
Mystery repeats x 4

What if i never went and smoked that first spliff
What if i never gave Sam that first kiss
What if i never even heard EPMD
Would you still notice me?

What if i never heard Perq's first demo
Gave him a call ""To the crib"" ,(Hey dog)
Would i still been known as the fellow
Rolling with the dude with the cello

What if
These questions arise
As I look in my eyes
And I see my own surprise

Wondering what path lies before me
Probably the same as the ones before me
And i, Pass it right down to my seed

A mystery indeed
I'd tell him how proud i'll be
Go ahead make history

Mystery Repeats 4x
As the newborn start to breathe
As the widow starts to grieve
It seems that mystery repeats itself all over

663,Andrew Bird,Masterfade,relaxed,"Well, you sure didn't look like you were having any fun
With that heavy-metal gaze they'll have to measure in tons
And when you look up at the sky
All you see are zeros
And all you see are zeros and ones
You took my hand and led me down to watch a kewpie doll parade
And we let the kittens lick our hair and drank our chalky lemonade
It's not that I just didn't care, I must admit I was afraid
And I'm awfully glad my finger's resting gently on the masterfade
The masterfade, I could have played along
The masterfade, I could have played Mah Jongg
But it just takes too long
And I just can't remember which way the east wind blows
Does it matter? If we're all matter
What's the matter?
Does it matter if we're all matter when we're done
When the sky is full of zeros and ones?
I saw you standing all alone in the electrostatic rain
I thought at last I'd found a situation you can't explain
With GPS, you know it's all just a matter of degrees
Your happiness won't find you underneath that canopy of trees
And if the green grass is six and the soybeans are seven
The June bugs are eight, the weeds and thistles are eleven
The ones just hold their place, the zeros make a smiley face
When they come floating down from the heavens
You took my hand and led me down to watch a papillon parade
And we let the kittens lick our hair and drank our chalky lemonade
You squeezed my hand and told me softly that I shouldn't be afraid
'Cause all the while your finger's resting gently on the masterfade
The masterfade, I could have played along
The masterfade, I could have played Mah Jongg
But it just takes too long
And who the hell can remember which way the east wind blows

When you're lying on the ground staring up at that inverted compass
I mean, Christ, who knows?2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",pop

As hard as the granite get
Never hesitant upon a mic strike, quick
Like an avalanche, hijack ya like a Comanche
I'm a man on a mission, rhyme vigilante

Don't feel me baby, it's just Justin
It feel good, right?

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
I kinda noticed, something wasn't right
From your colorful face
It's kind of weird to me
Since you're so fine
If it's up to me, your face will change

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Just remember
Sing a song with me

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (Hey!)
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

See, people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
If you smile, then that should set the tone
Just be limber, baby
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Baby, just remember

In the mall kids ask ""How the chain glow?""
Point to her they say, ""Wow, it's the same glow""
Point to me I say, ""Yeah, it's the same dough""
We the same type, you my a-like (Yeah)
You have me sleepin' in the same bed every night
Go ride wit me you deservin' the best
Take a few shots, let it burn in your chest
We could ride down, pumpin' N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play number three, joint called ""Brain"" (I just love your... brain)
Ma, took a hint, make me swerve in the lane
The name Malicious and I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake - now how heavy is that?

You was livin' in your Dae Woo
You were wearin' chit-chat shoes
You were illin' on voo doo
Yeah, you were tryin' to hex me
All tellin' me I'm sexy
Yeah, always tryin' to text me
Or dance next to me
Sayin'...

Listen to your body tonight
It's gonna treat you right
Don't be scared to fall in love
Cos you don't like heights
Listen to your body tonight
It's gonna treat you right

So now you're on my bedroom
All talkin' bout some boom boom
But you really shouldn't assume
Cos my man is coming home soon
He ain't tryin' to have a rival
You best think of your survival
Yeah, I ain't tryin' to be liable
I swear it on the Bible
I swear it on the Bible
Listen to your body tonight
It's gonna treat you right
Don't be scared to fall in love
Cos you don't like heights
Listen to your body tonight
It's gonna treat you right

Alright, hello?

679,Love Is All,Make Out Fall Out Make Up,sad,"Records and clothes on the floor
Remind me of the night before
A pounding pain in my head
I think I'll spend all day in bed

A thousand cigarettes went nuts
The stranger's hand in mine went white
Smudged lipstick, feeling sick
Make out, fall out, make up

Make out, fall out, make up, fall out

Dancing in the living room
With light supplied by the moon
Things I've said but shouldn't
Tricks I've tried but couldn't

Sorry if the music's too loud
Now the air is thicker than the cloud
Did I really call you
I was looking for someone I knew

Make out, fall out, make up, fall out
Fall out (fades) Make up fall out!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock
680,The Byrds,Hickory Wind,sad,"In South Carolina, there're many tall pines
I remember the oak tree that we used to climb
But now when I'm lonesome I always pretend
That I'm gettin' the feel of hickory wind

I started out younger, had most everything
All the riches and pleasures, what else can life bring?
But it makes me feel better each time you begin
Callin' me home, hickory wind

It's a hard way to find out that trouble is real
In a faraway city with a faraway feel
But it makes me feel better each time you begin
Callin' me home, hickory wind
Keeps callin' me home, hickory windEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

Uneasy feeling, burning out my eyes
I hope the end is less painful than my life
I stand on trial before the gods on Judgement Day
A blink of an eye between the cradle and the grave

[Pre-Chorus]
One last look at visions of flesh
The last best hope of man on earth
Pontius Pilate still washin' his hands
The world don't want to be saved, only left alone

[Chorus]
(Elysian fields) We are storming the heavens
(Elysian fields) To raise the swords and shields
(Elysian fields) We ascend to our destiny
(Elysian fields) To the Elysian fields

[Verse 2]
Soaring to the sun with blood upon their wings
Superstitious dust left twisting in the wind
Man still has one belief, one decree that stands alone
The laying down of arms is like cancer to their bones

[Pre-Chorus]
One last look at visions of flesh
The last blessed hope of man on earth
Pontius Pilate still washin' his hands
The world don't want to be saved, only left alone

682,Slayer,Praise of Death,angry,"[Verse 1]
Deceased in mind, decree of death
Blackened heart baptized in fire
Exertion, now need to blitz
Vicious ways brought up in Hell
Draw the line, life or death
Potent thrust, excessive pain
Massive dose, adrenaline
Minor threat cannot decline

[Chorus]
Stricken to live, Hell on Earth
Shackled and bound, we lie
Praise of death, life's a dream
We're only living to die

[Verse 2]
Victim of life, insanity lives
Deep in shock, intensive care
Tables turned, blast of strength
Kill at once, time to prevail
Begin to crank, feel the rush
Start to rage, take to extremes
Push too far, overkill
Time to die, no way to win
[Chorus]
Stricken to live, Hell on Earth
Shackled and bound, we lie
Praise of death, life's a dream
We're only living to die

[Lead - King]

[Bridge]
Running and hunting and slashing and crushing and
Searching and seeing and stabbing and shooting and
Thrashing and smashing and burning, destroying and
Killing and bleeding and pleading, then death

[Lead - King and Hanneman]

[Verse 3]
At Mach 10 velocity
Pressure builds, can't take the strain
Life blood flows to its grave
Dripping sweat, death shall erase
Time to think, time to breathe
Feel the pulse, life will expire
Surging speed, hell-a-fast
Cardiac, cease to exist
[Chorus]
Stricken to live, Hell on Earth
Shackled and bound, we lie
Praise of death, life's a dream
We're only living to die

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man

Well you know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life
Trying just to make you toe the line

(Yeah boy!)
Bass! How low can you go?
Death row what a brother knows
Once again, back is the incredible
The rhyme animal
The uncannable D, Public Enemy number one
Five-O said ""Freeze!"" and I got numb
Can't I tell 'em that I really never had a gun?
But it's the wax that the Terminator X spun
Now they got me in a cell cause my records they sell
Cause a brother like me said ""Well
Farrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
What he can say to you, what you ought to do""
Follow for now, power to the people say
""Make a miracle, D, pump the lyrical""
Black is back, all in, we're gonna win
Check it out (Yeah y'all come on!)
Here we go again

[Chorus – Anthrax]
Turn it up! Bring the noise!

[Verse 2 – Chuck D]
Never badder than bad cause the brother is madder than mad
At the fact that's corrupt as a senator
Soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope
Cause the beats in the lines are so dope
Listen for lessons I'm saying inside music that the critics are
Blasting me for
They'll never care for the brothers and sisters now across the
Country has us up for the war
We got to demonstrate, come on now, they're gonna have to wait
Till we get it right
Radio Stations I question their blackness
They call themselves black, but we'll see if they play this

[Chorus – Anthrax]
Turn it up! Bring the noise!

[Verse 3 – Scott Ian]
Get from in front of me, the crowd runs to me
My deejay is warm, he's X, I call him Norm, ya know
He can cut a record from side to side
So what, the ride, the glide should be much safer than a suicide
Soul control, beat is the father of your rock'n'roll
Music for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band, man
Makin' a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, ya know
You call 'em demos, but we ride limos, too
Whatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you
Beat is for Sonny Bono, beat is for Yoko Ono
Run DMC first said a deejay could be a band
Stand on its feet, get you out your seat
Beat is for Eric B., and LL as well, hell
Wax is for Anthrax, still it can rock bells
Ever forever, universal, it will sell
Time for me to exit, Terminator X-it

[Chorus – Anthrax]
Turn it up! Bring the noise!

[Verse 4 – Scott Ian]
From coast to coast, so you stop being like a comatose
'Stand, my man? The beat's the same with a boast dose
Rock with some pizzazz, it will last why you ask?
Roll with the rock stars, still never get accepted as
We got to plead the fifth, we can investigate
Don't need to wait, get the record straight
Hey, posse's in effect, got the Flavor Terminator
X to sign checks, play to get paid
We got to check it out down on the avenue
A magazine or two is dissing me and dissing you

He's on the make, he's on the take
And I'd never let him touch my heart

Well, he's lucky he just walked on by
If he ever met, a girl like me, are you kidding?

Cause I spill things from stirring 'em too quickly

I laugh at stupid things
Just cause they tickle me

Sometimes I wish
Sometimes I wish I was like Mariella

And she glued her lips together
So she never had to speak
Never had to speak
Never had to speak
People used to say she's as quiet as a mouse
She just doesn't make a peep
She marched to her wardrobe
And threw away the color
Because wearing black looks mysterious
But it didn't impress her mother
She wanted to dress her baby
In patterns and flowers
But Mariella just crossed her arms
And so she cried for hours
Mariella, Mariella
My pretty baby girl
Unglue your lips from being together and
And wear some pink and pearls
You can have your friends 'round
And they can stay for tea
Won't you just try to fit in please
Do this for me

But Mariella just crossed her arms
As she walked up the stairs
And she went into her bedroom
And she sat on her bed
And she looked in the mirror
And she thought to herself
""If I wanna play, I can play with me
If I wanna think, I'll think in my head""

At school, Mariella didn't have many friends
Yeah, the girls they all looked at her
And they thought she was quite strange
And the boys they're not really into girls at that age
And the teachers, they thought Mariella was just going through a phase
But Mariella just smiled as she skipped down the road
Because she knew all the secrets in her world
Yes, she always got the crossword puzzles right everyday
And she could do the alphabet backwards
Without making any mistakes
Mariella, Mariella
The pretty, pretty girl
Mariella, Mariella
Happy in her own little world
Happy in her own little world

I keep imagining
And over and over again
I fear it's true
Over and over again
Am I still haunted
Haunted by the thought of you

Your dark eyes peering
Through the wallpaper's design
You live in all the constellations
Or have I lost my mind
In the bottom of a bottle
Reflected in a spoon

I've embellished my life, now God please tell me is this what death's like?
[?], kept his innocence, heavy hearted spouse
Clingin on to anything intimate she can find around the house
What's the difference between Bush and Saddam?
Sheik Ahmed Yassin, Osama Bin Laden or Idi Amin
Fidel Castro, it seems to me they on the same team
They hate only lead to innocent blood streams
If it's so important for us to fight for mankind
Well I don't see none of they kinfolk out there on the front line
[Chorus]
And I'm a soldier
Right here hip-hop with my guns by my side
Ready to ride till I die and I'm a soldier
And you can see it in my eyes, even when the man dies
They say a soldier never cries and I'm a soldier
Until the day they take my life

All my soldiers match with me (left, right)

Am I better off this way?

Saying you should be with me instead

What would it be like with you around

Cold and roaming in the wild
I'm forever changed
By someone I never knew
Now I've, I've got a place
I've got a husband and a child
But I'll never forget
What I've given up in you

Where you are the valet of honour and i am the thief

How from a beautiful girl I became someone ruined and wrecked
It was all in your back
All in your back

So I spin in the dance of your absence and put on a show
But why do I smile baby, you of all people should know
The one that you loved
Died a long time ago

You can't do me wrong with charity until
You'll exhaust your lies and remedies, you will
But with your voice and melodies you kill, you kill
Your version of glory is dark and it's covered with sin
And I wanna dive in an ocean of pink tourmaline
I've seen the pure souls they exist and they fly
I think I could live with it, I know I can now

You can't do me wrong with charity until
You'll exhaust your lies and remedies, you will
But with your voices and melodies you kill, you kill

It's funny how now that I'm not in the palm of your hand
You're still running blindly to save me again and again

Into Alice's drive

Two kids in the park
Carved our initials
Deep in the bark

As the big limousine pulled slowly
Out of Alice's drive

Who gave me all my answers

Where it used to be your face
Is an empty space

Oh, where have you gone
And do you miss me
And what we used to do?

One family lost a star
That's why I wait and watch
To find out where you are

That's why I sit at home alone

Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, ""Slim Shady, you a basehead"" (Uh-uh)
""Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted""
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; ""Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg""

Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, ""Let's just be friends""
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her

Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)

Stuck in the game
Me against the world, baby

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets
Though bodies is droppin' there ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children, 'cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard-headed bastard, maybe he'll listen in his casket
The aftermath: more bodies bein' buried
I'm losin' my homies in a hurry, they're relocatin' to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurry
The question is will I live, no one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses
'Cause this is how it is, what's the use?
Unless we're shootin', no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world, baby
[Chorus: 2Pac & Puff Johnson]

Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself, see
Ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein' Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons
Already crazy and screamin', I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route for a crooked Outlaw?
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

[Verse 3: E.D.I. Mean]
Everyday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
Scheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'
'Cause ain't no bucks to stack up
My nuts is backed up, I'm about to act up
Go load the MAC up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'
And evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'
So what? Go put some work in and make my mail
Makin' sales, riskin' 25 with a L, but oh well

It's just me against the world, baby
[Verse 4: 2Pac]
With all this extra stressin'
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this oppression?
They punish the people that's askin' questions
And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons
Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let this pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothin' like the game; it's just me against the world
[Chorus: 2Pac & Puff Johnson]

Feel my arms around you

Waited just to love you

[Verse 1]
So, you've been to school for a year or two
And you know you've seen it all
In daddy's car, thinkin' you'll go far
Back east, your type don't crawl
Play ethnicky jazz to parade your snazz
On your five-grand stereo
Braggin' that you know how the niggers feel cold
And the slums got so much soul

[Pre-Chorus]
It's time to taste what you most fear
Right Guard will not help you here
Brace yourself, my dear
Brace yourself, my dear

[Chorus]
It's a holiday in Cambodia
It's tough, kid, but it's life
It's a holiday in Cambodia
Don't forget to pack a wife

[Verse 2]
You're a star-belly sneech, you suck like a leech
You want everyone to act like you
Kiss ass while you bitch so you can get rich
But your boss gets richer off you
Well, you'll work harder with a gun in your back
For a bowl of rice a day
Slave for soldiers till you starve
Then your head is skewered on a stake
[Pre-Chorus]
Now you can go where people are one
Now you can go where they get things done
What you need, my son
What you need, my son

Is a holiday in Cambodia
Where people dress in black
A holiday in Cambodia
Where you'll kiss ass or crack

731,Acceptance,In Too Far,relaxed,"[Verse 1]
The worst time to hit you with my first line, no
Everything seemed fine, when I hold you like you’re one-of-a-kind
You said you were a sure sign, it’s feeling like the last time
Play it back, it’s going over and over
Give it up and pull me through
All of this to tell you

[Chorus]
I’ve been thinking
Take me now, I’m in too far
Can’t stop feeling
Doesn’t matter who you are
This could be my last goodbye
You could stay, I’ll be alright
I’ve been thinking
Take me now, I’m in too far

If I might say, all of this seems to flow away
From your lips when they’re kissing me
And your hips when they're leaving me
For the last time, I’m thinking of the first time
The first time, I’m thinking of the last time
Play it back, it’s going over and over
You’re trying me so I’m moving on
All of this to tell you

I’ve been thinking
Take me now, I’m in too far
Can’t stop feeling
Doesn’t matter who you are
This could be my last goodbye
You could stay, I’ll be alright

Take me now, I’m in too far

Well you know how this world can beat you down
And I'm made of clay
I fear I'm the only one who thinks this way

I'm always falling down the same hill
Bamboo puncturing this skin
And nothing comes bleeding out of me just like a waterfall I'm drowning in
Two feet below the surface I can still make out your wavy face
And if I could just reach you maybe I could leave this place

I have lived so many lives all in my head
Don't tell me that you care
There really isn't anything, now, is there?

You would know, wouldn't you?
You extend your hand to those who suffer
To those who know what it really feels like
To those who've had a taste
Like that means something
And oh so sick I am
And maybe I don't have a choice
And maybe that is all I have
And maybe this is a cry for help

All these drugs and one night stands
So I tremble when I think of what she'd do
She'd say something like, ""You're no good
You're like the junkies in this neighborhood""
We all need a fix, I guess I need one too
But I'm trying madly to calm these nerves with something new

I got this heavy debt, I've got nothing left
But this daunting weight slung 'round my neck
You got the callous mouth, all your endless doubts
We spent this fifteen weeks, trying to work it out
Do you think we're getting to something new?

Oh God, not another fight
I'm always trying to get the details right
I remember when you told me you felt saved
When you promised you'd lay flowers on my grave
Just like they used to do
Is it something new?

And now here I stand with these blood soaked hands
On this sleepless night, that never ends
And these songs I sing
With these hopes that I cling to
Desperately wondering
Are we finally getting to something new?
Is it something new?
Are we finally to something new?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

She wears suits and buys him flowers
Smokes his cigarettes and bakes him cakes

She's got green eyes and she's lovely
Reminds me of the 'it' girl with her lips
Got an automatic license
Reads all Dostoievsky's household tips

He says uh oh i love you
But i'm not sure i trust you
You seem strange to me

How come everyone suspects her
Attach her to a lie detector
Watch a thousand housewives fizz and burn
And every time she answers yes
The needles on his polygraph test
Just go round in circles like his brain

She's got long hair but she's ugly
Got a touch of Einstein to her brain
She wears fat clothes but she's cunning
People say she's easy all the same
He says uh oh i love you
But i'm not sure i trust you

It took a thousand cliches just to scold her
Took a man from Stepford and a tape recorder
Got his ego broken, so crestfallen

Way that we say 'em in style that we writ 'em in
Massive Attack, we keep it strong just like a vitamin
Going for the positive, wiping out the negative songs
'Cause, brother, it's relative
The passer's picking up all the lyrics on the dance floor
That raise your spirit level 'cause it demands for
Attitude is cool, degrees below zero
Up against the wall, behaving like De Niro
Tricky's performing, taking his phono
Making a stand with a tan, touch it like cocoa
Smooth to keep you moving at the back now
Free is the needle, it's moving through the track now
Dance to the drummer's beats, we need new sticks
Bounce around the vibes like acoustics
No drugs or pharmaceuticals, for the body, ain't suitable
Stick with liquid, me and Trick, we drop
A paper which you use my tongue to lick with
Trouble and strife ain't no sunshine in my life
Wiseguys get protection when they carry a knife
They shouldn't have been born, they're making me yawn
But I just take it easy, it's a Sunday morn'
So, you come on light my fire and
Together we'll grow forever, watch my Akai rig go
Because my Akai rig goes boom, boom
My Akai rig goes boom
Yeah, rhymin' the jam and, uh, we got the stamina
In case you never know us if we don't give a damn and uh
And it's hard to handle, keep your distance
Resist and the posse gets the pleasure of this dance
The cool breeze that you welcome in the heat
You don't see it but you feel it when it's blowing on the street
If I was a rich man
Da da dada
I quietly observe, standing in my space
It's the devious days they call the rat race
It's a concrete jungle, evil in the town
Weebles, wobble, occasional squabble
But what happen when the bomb drops Down
Don't make sound, yes
'Cause the dance floor's a desert and the dancers are parched
Do a rain dance and your brain's still marsh
My heavy, my brother get lighter than helium
Float above the world to break the tedium
Living in my headphones, Sony's what I say to 'em
The surreal boom of the Budokan stadium

Can't be with the one I love, I love the one that I miss
I'm very down to earth but brain sits on top floor
Don't need another lover just need, I'm insecure
The weather is a-changin', the storms be shakin'
The love that you take is equal to the love you're makin'
Here comes the sun little darlin here comes the sun (It's alright)
Yes, tricky kid, I check my situation
Maggie this, Maggie that, Maggie means inflation
Hip-hop, you don't stop, 'cause I'm not sloppy
I like the beat so we need another copy
We're natives of the massive territory and we're proud
Get peaceful in the dance, adapt the glory and the crowd
The problem ain't a different kind of skin tricks
I love my neighbor, I don't wait for the olympics
See you go hooligan, you're trying to play the fool again
Caught you in the lost and found
When your posse weren't around

744,Manic Street Preachers,4st 7lb,angry,"[Sampled Intro]
""I eat too much to die and not enough to stay alive. I'm sitting in the middle waiting.""
[Verse 1]
Days since I last pissed
Cheeks sunken and despaired
So gorgeous, sunk to 6st
Lose my only remaining home
See my third rib appear
A week later all my flesh disappears
Stretch taut, cling-film on bone
I'm getting better

[Bridge 1]
Karen says I've reached my target weight
Kate and Emma and Kristen know it's fake
Problem is diet's not a big enough word
I wanna be so skinny that I rot from view

[Chorus]
Ah ah, ah ah ah
I want to walk in the snow
And not leave a footprint
Ah ah, ah ah ah
I want to walk in the snow
And not soil its purity
[Verse 2]
Stomach collapsed at five
Lift up my skirt, my sex is gone
Naked and lovely and 5st 2
May I bud and never flower
My vision's getting blurred
But I can see my ribs and I feel fine
My hands are trembling stalks
And I can feel my breasts are sinking

[Bridge 2]
Mother tries to choke me with roast beef
And sits savouring her sole Ryvita
That's the way you're built my father said
But I can change, my cocoon shedding

[Chorus]
Ah ah, ah ah ah
I want to walk in the snow
And not leave a footprint
Ah ah, ah ah ah
I want to walk in the snow
And not soil its purity

[Outro]
Kate and Kristin and Kit Kat
All things I like looking at
Too weak to fuss, too weak to die
Choice is skeletal in everybody's life
I choose, my choice, I starve to frenzy
Hunger soon passes and sickness soon tries
Legs bend, stockinged I am Twiggy
And I don't mind the horror that surrounds me
Self-worth scatters, self-esteem's a bore
I long since moved to a higher plateau
This discipline's so rare so please applaud
Just look at the fat scum who pamper me so
Yeah, 4st 7, an epilogue of youth
Such beautiful dignity in self-abuse
I've finally come to understand life
Through staring blankly at my navelEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

Prevail and ride

Into the black hole
Searching for crystal
Making the veins bleed

One million voices
Dispelling
A thousand faces
Disarming
Running through the darkness
Holding hearts in my eyes
Falling short of gauntlet
Covered in blood-sucking flies

Suicide

Impossible to forgive, forget it, murderer

Drag the blade and go away

I want to eat a bullet
Carve myself
Beat my face
Catatonic
Dig my brain
No pain! suffocate!
Stomach aches
Don't give a fuck
I'm out, I'm done
Fuck this shit
You've dug the hole
I'm lying in

Ohhhh, you did it to me once again my friend
I swear you do it to me everytime
Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on
On and on and on

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
This is the year that I come in and just devastate
My style is great ask your peoples can I dominate?
My rhymes are harder than last night's erection
Don't play me close, I'll have this mic up in your mid-section
My shit is lovely simply meaning that my joint is tight
Amping up the mic making sure production's tight
Sometimes I might catch a severe case of writer's block
But by the end of the day you'll be on my jock
My name's Malik my hobby's putting MC's to the test
And if you front I'll put my foot up in your freaking chest
Freestyle fanatic, and never will it ever stop
You crew is loose, you might just want to call the cops
[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Aye, yo I gotta put some action on paper
Make sure my verse jump up and spread out like the raper
The only tip I got for a waiter
Is watch the doorknob hit me where the dirty dog shoulda' bit me
That was my train of thought, but for so long I fought
Now I'm at a level supreme to the devil
So turn up the bass and lay low on the treble
We be the real MC's and you dead, bring a shovel
Revitalize, the vital Tribe nigga, WHAT?
The ladies sweat the style like the squirrel sweat the nuts
You know a fellas good for the moola
Don't smoke no woolas, read the name call me Slick Tip the Ruler

Ohhhh, you did it to me once again my friend
I swear you do it to me everytime
Cause you stay crazy on my mind
Yo you got it goin on (say word), on and on and on

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Yo I've been treading on this globe man for twenty-five joints
Sometimes Shaitan got me by the pressure points
But I can break a fella down like sex
You eat Wheat Chex but still light in the ass and can't flex
If one nigga front I'mma make more pay
Cause tonight, we gettin off like O.J
And yo I got a Dawg that bites, fuck the barking
Yo I got a crew with the beats and the smarts and
[Verse 4: Phife]
I fought my shit up on Linden in the one-nine-two
Forever writing never biting ain't shit else to do
Hoping to battle, but most MC's ain't ready yet
But if they utter one word then it's as good as set
You have MC's dropping bombs that's incredible
Some of the brothers, their styles are just despicable
As for me see I just do how I love to do
Try to deny me of my props then I'll be seeing you
Most of you suckers wanna be down for the tag along
The freaking fame, someone tell em that this shit ain't games
You gots to do this from your heart meaning your inner soul
And if it's real only then will you be on a roll
I try to stay on top my game there ain't no time to lose
Four albums deep as a Quester but still we payin' dues
So hear me out one time, you got to be yourself
Cause if you ain't yourself you end up by your freaking self
I'm coming rugged with the Linden Boule type of slang
And yo, we'll see who can hang yo

And dying in waves

History's lessons drowned in red wine
Poppies for young men, death's bitter trade
All of those young lives betrayed
All for a Children's Crusade
[Chorus]
The children of England
Would never be slaves
They're trapped on the wire
And dying in waves
The flower of England
Face down in the mud
And stained in the blood
Of a whole generation

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
The children of England
Would never be slaves
They're trapped on the wire
And dying in waves
The flower of England
Face down in the mud
And stained in the blood
Of a whole generation

Midnight in Soho, Nineteen Eighty-four
Fixing in doorways, opium slaves
Poppies for young men, such bitter trade
All of those young lives betrayed

766,James Taylor,That Lonesome Road,sad,"Walk down that lonesome road
All by yourself
Don't turn your head
Back over your shoulder
And only stop to rest yourself
When the silver moon
Is shining high
Above the trees

If I had stopped to listen once or twice
If I had closed my mouth and opened my eyes
If I had cooled my head and warmed my heart
I'd not be on this road tonight

Carry on, carry on
Never mind feeling sorry for yourself
It doesn't save you from your troubled mind

Walk down that lonesome road
All by yourself
Don't turn your head
Back over your shoulder
And only stop to rest yourself
When the silver moon

These niggas wanna shine like me (Me)
Rhyme like me (Me)
They don't walk around with a 9 like me (Me)
They don't want to do it 3 to 9 like me
And ain't strong enough to take 9 like me
Ayo, you think about shittin' on fifty, save it
My songs belong in the Bible with King David's
I teach niggas sign language, that ain’t deaf, son
[click click] you heard that? That mean run
Ask around, I ain't the one you wanna stunt on, pa
Pull through, I throw a fucking cocktail at ya car
From the last shootout I got a dimple on my face
It's nothing, I can go after Mase fan base
Shell hit my jaw, I ain't wait for doc to get it out
Hit my wisdom tooth [huck-too] spit it out
I don't smile a lot 'cause ain't nothin' pretty
Got a purple heart for war and I ain't never left the city
Hoes be like ""Fiddy, you so witty""
On the dick like they heard I ghostwrite for P. Diddy
You got fat while we starve, it's my turn
I done felt how the shells burn, I still won't learn
Won't learn

[Verse 2]
Mama said everything that happened to us, was part of God's plan
So at night when I talk to him I got my gun in my hand
Don't think I'm crazy 'cause I don't fear man
'Cause I fear when I kill a man God won't understand
I got a head full of evil thoughts, am I Satan?
I been could've killt these niggas, I'm still waitin'
In the telly with two whores, Benz with two doors
32 karats in the cross, no flaws
You see me in the hood, I got at least two guns
I carry the Glock, Tony carry my M-1
Hold me down, nigga, OGs tryin' to rock me
D's waiting for my response to lock me
This is my hustle, nigga, don't knock me
You need some shit with a banana clip to try and stop me
I'm the one
[Chorus]
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me

You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me

[Verse 3]
See, I done been to the Pearly Gates, they sent me back
Good die young, I ain't eligible for that
I shot niggas, I been shot, sold crack in the street
My attitude is gangsta, so I stay in some beef
You wanna get acquainted with me, you wanna know me
From 3 point range with a Glock, I shoot better than Kobe
See a nigga standing next to me, he probably my Co-D
See a bitch getting in my whip, she probably gon' blow me
See the flow is like a .38, it’s special y'all
A country boy tell 'ya ""I’m finna to blow""
I’m more like a pimp than a trick, you know
You see, I’m in this for the paper, but I don’t love the hoes
Niggas broke in the hood worryin' about mines
Grown ass men wearing starter kit shines
You know 'em little pieces with the little stones
Got little clientele fiends call your cell phones
When the gossipin' start, I'm always the topic
You too old for that shit, dawg, won’t you stop it?
Shorty, I've been watching you watching me
Now you tell me what you like more, my watch or me? Ha ha
[Chorus]
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me

Some think I'm a criminal but, yo I ain't all of that
Hit'cha with the baseball bat when ya wanna ill though
Wanna mess around, you get fucked on the hill bro
Kick it like a steel toe, real slow hits from the bong
Make me feel like Cheech and I'm kickin' it wit' Chong
Just like Cheech and Chong frontin' with ""Ice Cream""
Cypress Hill is here to give you a nice dream
Speak it like a rolla', and you know it's rolled tightly
I'm like the funky beat, so, why ya tryin' ta fight me
Pigs often site me, that's not polite G
And any hour of the day ya know I might be
Harassed by a pig real fast
They wanna Rodney King me, always tryin'a crown my ass
Ain't got no class (Sen Dog: No Class)
I hit they' ass like the buddah that's stinky
They wanna' scruff but, they' just so rinky-dinky
I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk
Sen got the Philly, and he's gonna light the blunt
Sippin' at the kufu make me go cuckoo!
Somethin' like loco then I turn into this loocoo
Bringin' the beta, yeah, now the funk is risin'
Got the beta bass and the nasal highs and
As I kick a trip, it comin' straight from my sinus
Crazy nasal vocals, cannot make the hotties loco
I remember sista Maggie, breasts were kinda saggy
Used to sell me buddha outta fucked up little baggies
Honey'd up a twenty even when I had no money
She said ""Pay me back with some Latin dick Sonnie""
Well I never went out, and I don't think I'm gonna
Just for some buddha, she wanted me to bone her
""Demeaning, ya think ya know what I meanin''
I got somethin' for the ho's ta be schemin' on
I'm the Buddha-Real I take a trip ta hoota'ville
I'll throw ya out the door... of my big blue Seville
Then light another joint, this ain't no exploitation (point)

Been through a lot of hardships in my life ya know ya know in my life
Must confess I disagreed with what he had to say

I heard payback's a motherfucking nigga
That's why I'm sick of getting treated like a goddamn stepchild
Fuck a punk, 'cause I ain't him
You gotta deal with the nine-double-M
The day is coming that you'll all hate
Just think if niggas decide to retaliate
They try to keep me from running up
I never tell you to get down, it's all about coming up
So what they do, go and ban the AK?
My shit wasn't registered any fucking way
So you better duck away, run and hide out
When I'm rolling real slow and the lights out
'Cause I'm about to fuck up the program
Shooting out the window of a drop-top Brougham
When I'm shooting, let's see who drop
The police, the media, and suckers that went pop?
And motherfuckers that say they too black
Put 'em overseas, they be begging to come back
And say we promote gangs and drugs
You wanna sweep a nigga like me up under the rug
Kicking shit called street knowledge
Why more niggas in the pen than in college?
Because of that line, I might be your cellmate
That's from the nigga ya love to hate

Once again it's on, the motherfucking psycho
Ice Cube the bitch-killer, cap-peeler
Yo, running through the line like Bo, there's no pot to piss in
I put my fist in
Now, who do ya love to hate?
Cause I talk shit and down the eight-ball 'cause I don't fake
You're begging I fall off
The crossover, might as well cut them balls off
And get your ass ready for the Lenching
The Mob is dropping common sense and
We'll gank in the pen, we'll shank
Any Tom, Dick and Hank, and get the ass spanked
It ain't about how right or wrong you live, but how long you live
I ain't with the bullshit
I meet mo' bitches, mo' hoes
Don't wanna sleep, so I keep popping No-Doz
And tell the young people what they gotta know
'Cause I hate when niggas gotta live low
And if you're locked up I dedicate my stylin'
From San Quentin to Rikers Island
We got 'em afraid of the funky shit
I like to clown so pump up the sound
In your Jeep, make the old ladies say
""Oh my god — brake, it's the nigga ya love to hate""

Soul Train done lost they soul
Just call it train cause the bitches look like hoes
I see a lotta others damn
It almost look like the Bandstand
You ask me: ""did I like Arsenio?""
About as much as the Bicentennial
I don't give a fuck about dissing these fools
'Cause they all scared of the Ice Cube
And what I say, what I portray and all that
And ain't even seen the gat
I don't wanna see no dancing
I'm sick of that shit -- listen to the hit
'Cause yo if I look and see another brother
On the video trying to out-dance each other
I'ma tell T-Bone to pass the bottle
And don't give me that shit about role model
It ain't wise to chastise and preach
Just open the eyes of each
'Cause laws are made to be broken up
What niggas need to do is start loc-ing up
And build mold and fold theyself into shape

As I lie between these covers

Backseat of her riverboat, cause

779,Ella Fitzgerald,Solitude ,relaxed,"In my solitude you haunt me
With reveries of days gone by
In my solitude you taunt me
With memories that never die
I sit in my chair
Filled with despair
Nobody could be so sad
With gloom ev'rywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad
In my solitude
I'm praying
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair
I'm filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom ev'rywhere

I know that I'll soon go mad

780,Ben Kweller,Thirteen,sad,"We've been in the rain
We've been on the mountain
We've been 'round the fire

In fancy hotels
Drank water from farm wells
We sang with the choir

I kissed your dry lips
We jumped off the high cliffs
And splashed down below

Skin to skin
In the salty river
Made love in the shadows
Woooah ooh

Read books to each other
Read the mind of the other
Flew 1,000 jets

We laughed and we cried
At movies and real life
And our ridiculous bets

We danced in the moonlight at midnight
We pressed against back doors and wood floors
And you never faked it
And frequently
We ignored our love
But we could never mistake it
Oooh ooh

We met on the front porch
Fell in love on the phone
Without the physical wreck

You gave me the necklace
That used to hang
Around your mother's neck

We questioned religions
Gave bread to the pigeons
We learned how to pray

We stood by the ocean
Turned our hearts into one
We layed in bed all day
Heeey

We skipped on the sidewalk
Skipped stones on the water
Skipped town
We've seen the sunrise with new eyes
We've seen the damage of gossip and true lies
We've seen the sun go down

Had passionate make outs
And passionate freak outs
We built this world of our own

It was in the back of a taxi
When you told me you loved me
And that I wasn't aloneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock
781,Ozzy Osbourne,Running Out of Time,angry,"[Verse 1]
Been around this world so many times
If you could only see my mind
I watch my secret heaven turn to hell
Faith alone has guided me
The ghost of my own destiny
I haven't even got a soul to sell
All the things I put me through
I wouldn't wish my hell on you
You'll never know what's going on inside

[Chorus]
Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of faith and hope and reason
I'm running out of time
Running out of time

[Verse 2]
Trouble always seems to find
A way to live inside my mind
My haunted head and me remain alone
Underneath my masquerade
A simple man who's so afraid
I try to find a light to guide me home
Momma please just hold me tight
Feeling so afraid tonight
'Cause you're the only one that really knows
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Fighting for my sanity
Many nights of tragedy
Got to leave my wretched ways behind

[Chorus]
Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of fate and hope and reason
I'm running out of time
Running out of timeI'm running out of time
Running out of time

782,Tindersticks,Travelling Light,sad,"There are places I don't remember
There are times and dates, they mean nothing to me
I've been looking through some of them old pictures
They don't serve to jog my memory

I'm not waking in the morning, staring at the walls these days
I'm not getting out the boxes, spread out all over the floor
I've been looking through some of them old pictures
Those faces, they mean nothing to me no more

[Chorus:]
Hey, I travel light
You travel light
Everything I've done
You say you can justify, mmm, you travel light

I can't pick them out, I can't put them in this sad old bag
Some things you have to lose along the way
When times are hard I'll only pick them out, wish I was going back
When times are good you'll be glad you ran away

[Chorus]

Do you remember how much you loved me?
You say you have no room in that thick old head
Well, it comes with the hurt and the guilt and the memories
If I had to take them with me I'd never get from my bed
But there's a crack in the roof where the rain pours through
That's the place you always decide to sit
Yeah I know I'm there for hours, the water running down my face
Do you really think you keep it all that well hid?
No, but I travel light
You don't travel light
Everything I've done
It's just a lie, you don't travel light

I invoke Thee!
Inside the shrine called life
By the seven wonders
By myriad mortals
That gone
And are to come
Outside!
Outside desert ov restriction
In act ov rebellion
On the sea ov motion
Stability ov matter
By serenity, strength and beauty
By the mighty chant ov every breath

In serpentine dance ov blood cells
In simplicity ov spells
Divine names, meta-games
I greet Thy presence

Oh Snake! Thou art God!
Coiled underneath my throne
With Thee I reunite
With blood we make this covenant
Myself I redefine
Look in and above:
There is more than the flesh
Look careful and Thou may see
The unextinguished flame
The nectar ov Thy rage
I taste from the cup ov fornication
And woman by my side
And scarlet is her skin
She's eager to rise
And so eager to please
Another day
Another eternity gone
And on the stairway to salvation
I walk alone among the falling stars
Looking for company
Where art Thou?
Oh, lacerate ones!

[Bass Lead: Orion]
[Lead: Nergal]
[Lead: Seth]

Arise! my sweetest friend
Or be forever fallen
We have finally arrived
From prison ov this life
To Kali's womb
Down to the earth
As angels ov almighty god-
Chaos!
'Tis our last fall
To touch our mother whore
The harlot ov the saints
That spits on the rotten cross
Incinerate the icon
The symbol ov all loss
To stand straight
At the left hand ov god
Samael! be Thou my ally!
Join me among the bright hosts
Wondering neither way ov light
Nor darkness
Ov which seed
Sprouts dispassionately
In the summer ov my life

Like bumping around the town like when you're driving a Range Rover
Expanding the horizon and expanding the parameters
Expanding the rhymes of sucka MC amateurs
Naugles, Isaac Newton, a scientific EZ
Ben Franklin with the kite, gettin’ ova with the key
Now rock, shocker the mike of the many times, times the times tables
Rock well to tell, dispel, all of the old fables
Cuz I be dropping the new science and I be kicking the new k-nowledge
An emcee to a degree that you can't get in college
Now the dregs of the Earth and the eggs that I eat
I've got pegs through my hands and one through my feet
Shea Stadium, the radium, E.M.D. squared
Kicked out of the Palladium, 'dja think that I cared?
It's the sounds of science, the sounds of science

Drunk as a skunk am I from celebration
To peep that freak unique penetration

I smell weak cuz y'all keep poppin' it

Did your mom get back from her business trip? (Business trip)
Is she there, or is she trying to give me the slip? (Give me the slip)

You know, I'm not the little boy that I used to be
I'm all grown up now, baby, can't you see?

[Chorus]
Stacy's mom has got it going on
She's all I want and I've waited for so long
Stacy, can't you see? You're just not the girl for me
I know it might be wrong, but I'm in love with Stacy's mom
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on

[Verse 2]
Stacy, do you remember when I mowed your lawn? (Mowed your lawn)
Your mom came out with just a towel on (Towel on)
I could tell she liked me from the way she stared (Way she stared)
And the way she said, ""You missed a spot over there"" (Spot over there)
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know that you think it's just a fantasy
But since your dad walked out, your mom could use a guy like me

Stacy's mom has got it going on
She's all I want and I've waited for so long
Stacy, can't you see? You're just not the girl for me
I know it might be wrong, but I'm in love with Stacy's mom

You are my knight in armor
The hero of my heart

A true world go up
The river is getting deep, believe it
You're all these arms of mine wanna hold
All wrapped up with a river
Baby, I'm giving you this heart of gold

""Hey!""
""This—""
""This is a journey—""
""—jour—""
""—journey, through sound""
""Would you join me, please, in welcome-in-ing—""
""Hahahaha""

[Verse 1]
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
Here's your ticket;
Hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to Black attack
So I sack and jack, then slapped the Mac
Now I'm ready to mic it
(You know I like it) huh
Hear my favoritism roll ""Oh""
Never be a brother like, ""Me go solo""
Laser, anesthesia, maze ya
Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way I'm livin', forgiven, what I'm givin' up
X on the flex, hit me now
I don't know about later
As for now, I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man, I've had it up to here
Yeah, I wear got 'em going in fear
Rhetoric said and read just a bit ago
Not quitting, though signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from getting jerked
Checkin' some ways (Ways)
To way back in the better days
Raw metaphysically bold, never followed a code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am, God knows, huh!
'Cause it's coming from the heart
What I got, better get some
Get on up, hustler of culture
Snake bitten, been spit in the face, huh!
But the rhymes keep fittin'
Respect's been given, how's ya livin'
Now I can't protect, a paid-off defect
Check the record and reckon an intentional wreck
Played, off as some intellect
Made the call, took the fall, broke the laws
Not my fault that they're fallin' off
Known as fair and square throughout my years
So I growl at the livin' foul
Black to the bone, my home is your home
But welcome to the Terrordome
[Interlude]
Come on down, get down
Come on, you can get it, get it, get it
Come on down, get down
Come on, you can get it, get it, get it
Come on down, get down
Come on, you can get it, get it, get it
Come on down, get down
Come on, you can get it, get it, get it
""Would you join me please in welcome-in-ing...""

[Ad-lib: Flavor Flav]
So long now, have a good trip!
Yo, yo, who put this thing together, huh? Me!
Me, that's who!
Who I trust? Who I trust?
Me, that's who!
Yo, who you trust, man?

[Verse 2]
Subordinate terror, kickin' off an era
Cold deliverin' pain
My '98 was '87 on a record, yo
So now I go Bronco
(Oh Chuck, they out to get us, man!
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh Chuck, they out to get us, man!
Yo, we gotta dust these boys off!)
Crucifixion ain't no fiction
So-called chosen frozen
Apology made to whoever pleases
Still they got me like Jesus
I rather sing, bring, think, reminisce
'Bout a brother while I'm in sync
Every brother ain't a brother 'cause a color
Just as well could be undercover
Backstabbed, grabbed a flag from the back of the lab
Told a Rab get off the rag
Sad to say, I got sold down the river
Still some quiver when I deliver
Never to say I never knew or had a clue
Word was Herb, plus hard on the boulevard
Lies, scandalizin', basin'
Traits of hate, who's celebratin' with Satan?
I rope-a-dope the evil with righteous, bobbin' and weavin'
And let the good get even
C'mon down (C'mon!)
But welcome to the Terrordome
[Verse 3]
Caught in the race against time, the pit and the pendulum
Check the rhythm and rhymes while I'm bending 'em
Snakes blowing up the lines of design (Would you join me please in welcome-in-ing...)
Trying to blind the science I'm sending 'em
How to fight the power, cannot run and hide
But it shouldn't be suicide
In a game, a fool without the rules
Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
Every brother ain't a brother
'Cause a black hand squeezed on Malcolm X the man
The shooting of Huey Newton
From a hand of a Nig who pulled the trig

[Verse 4]
It's weak to speak and blame somebody else
When you destroy yourself
First, nothin' worse
Than a mother's pain of a son slain in Bensonhurst
Can't wait for the state to decide the fate
So this jam I dedicate
Places with the racist faces
Example, one of many places
Greek, week-end, speech, I speak
From a lesson, learned in Virginia
I don't smile in the line of fire, I go wildin'
But it's on bass and drums, even violins
Whatcha do, getcha head ready
Instead of getting physically sweaty
When I get mad, I put it down on a pad, huh!
Give ya something that ya never had
Controllin', fear of high rollin'
God bless your soul and keep livin'
Never allowed, kickin' it loud
Droppin' a bomb, brain game, intellectual Vietnam
Move as a team, never move alone
But welcome to the Terrordome2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",hip hop

""Y'all motherfuckers ready for N.W.A? Well get the fuck up!""
""A bitch is a bitch. So if you're poor—""
“It was once said by a man who couldn’t quit, dope—”
“Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say”
But now, since he stepped the fuck off

[Verse 1]
Goddamn, I'm glad y'all set it off
Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the AK
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le
Looking like straight Bozos
I saw it coming, that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
While y'all mothafuckers moved straight outta Compton
Living with the whites
One big house and not another nigga in sight
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas now I'm making all the dough
White man just ruling
The Niggas With Attitudes? Who ya foolin'?
Y'all niggas just phony
I put that on my Mama and my dead homies
Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losing
Ay yo Dre, stick to producing
Calling me Arnold, but you been-a-dick
Eazy-E saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But I'm a man, and ain't nobody humping me
Trying to sound like Amerikkka's Most?
You could yell all day, but you don't come close
'Cause you know I'm the one that flowed
Ya done run 100 miles, but you still got one to go
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B
And y'all disgrace the C-P-T
'Cause you're getting fucked out your green
By a white boy, with no vaseline
[Hook]
Now you're getting done without vaseline
Now you're getting done without vaseline
Now you're getting done without vaseline
Damn, it feels good to see people, on it
[Verse 2]
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peeling
Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?
You're getting fucked real quick
And Eazy's dick is smelling like MC Ren's shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a ho be a ho, so
I couldn't stop you from getting ganked
Now let's play big-bank-take-little-bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
'Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair? Naw, cut them balls
'Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Getting money out your ass like a mothafucking Ready Teller
Giving up the dollar bills
Now they got The Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
'Cause he's going out like Kunta Kinte
But I got a whip for ya, Toby
Used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide-and-conquer
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yelling Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren
'Cause I remember when you drove a B-210
Broke as a mothafucking joke
Let you on the scene to back up the First Team
It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart
And they ripping your asshole apart
By taking your green
Oh yeah, The Villain does get fucked with no vaseline
[Hook]
Now you're getting done, get-getting done
Now you're getting done, get-getting done
Now you're getting done without va-va-va-va-vaseline

[Verse 3]
I never have dinner with the President
I never have dinner with the President
I never have dinner with the President
And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half-pint bitch, fucking your homeboys, you little maggot
Eazy-E turned faggot
With your manager, fella
Fucking MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me
Eazy-E a'be hanging from a tree
With no vaseline
Just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on
Till that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation
Off the massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga, what you thinking bout?!
Get rid of that Devil real simple
Put a bullet in his temple
'Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white jew telling you what to do
Pulling wools with your scams
Now I gotta play the Silence of the Lambs
With a midget who's a punk, too
Tryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you
Eric Wright, punk, always into something
Gettin' fucked at night
By Mista Shitpacker
Bend over for the goddamn cracker
No vaseline

Where all your world's a stage
And in this silent rage
Can you turn the page into something new
The fantasies of burdened beasts
But kings and queens won't even dream of peace

If I could let these thoughts drown
Then someday she might lose her crown
In time these chains that hold me down would set me free

No more screams or shouts
You're quiet as a mouse
And in this slaughterhouse
Is there no way out of here
They feed the fears and hide the griefs of burdened beasts
Cause kings and queens won't even dream of peace

If I could let these thoughts drown
And someday he might lose his crown
In time these chains that hold me down would set me free
Would set me free

Don't look back and don't look down
You'll fall into that wishing well
You're frozen under someone's spell
That keeps you running in and out of luck
If I could let these thoughts drown
And someday she might lose her crown
In time these chains that hold me down would set me free

Step a little closer if you please

814,Switchfoot,Let Your Love Be Strong,sad,"[Verse 1]
In this world of news, I've found nothing new
I've found nothing pure
Maybe I'm just idealistic to assume that truth
Could be fact and form
That love could be a verb
Maybe I'm just a little misinformed
As the dead moon rises and the freeways sigh
Let the trains watch over the tides and the mist
Spinning circles in our skies tonight
Let the trucks roll in from Los Angeles
Maybe our stars are unanimously tired

[Chorus]
Let your love be strong and I don't care what goes down
Let your love be strong enough to weather through the thundercloud
Fury and thunder clap like stealing the fire from your eyes
All of my world hanging on your love

[Verse 2]
Let the wars begin, let my strength wear thin
Let my fingers crack, let my world fall apart
Train the monkeys on my back to fight
Let it start tonight
When my world explodes
When my stars touch the ground
Falling down like broken satellites
[Chorus]
Let your love be strong, and I don't care what goes down
Let your love be strong enough to weather through the thunder cloud
Fury and thunder clap like stealing the fire from your skies
All that I am hanging on
All of my world resting on your loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",pop

Sister of night
When the hunger descends
And your body's a fire
An inferno that never ends
An eternal flame
That burns in desire's name

[Verse 2]
Sister of night
When the longing returns
Giving voice to the flame
Calling you through flesh that burns
Breaking down your will
To move in for the kill

[Chorus]
Oh, sister, come for me
Embrace me, assure me
Hey sister, I feel it too
Sweet sister, just feel me
I'm trembling, you heal me
Hey sister, I feel it too

[Interlude]

Sister of night
In your saddest dress
As you walk through the light
You're desperate to impress
So you slide to the floor
Feeling insecure

Sister of night
With the loneliest eyes
Tell yourself it's alright
He'll make such a perfect prize
But the cold light of day
Will give the game away

Hey sister, I feel it too

816,Machine Head,Take my Scars,angry,"[Verse 1]
It's been around for a thousand years
And it'll be here for plenty more
It is the face hidden in disgrace
That has become now an open sore

It is a false messiah
It is the face of pain
The bringer of the bittersweet
The heretic insane

[Chorus]
Take my scars
Through hands of God
I found a better way
To break the walls

[Verse 2]
Fed all the lies and desensitized
Taught to believe that it is the way
Taught to divide and exactly why
You'll never understand my rage

You've never had to borrow
You've never had to steal
You eat it with your silver spoon
For me it's real
[Chorus]
Take my scars
Through hands of God
I found a better way
To break the walls

[Solo : Robb Flynn]

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemondrops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, then, oh why can't I?

823,Marty Robbins,El Paso,relaxed,"[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Feleena would whirl

[Verse 2]
Blacker than night were the eyes of Feleena
Wicked and evil while casting her spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain, I could tell

[Chorus 1]
One night, a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Feleena, the girl that I love

[Verse 3]
So in anger, I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

[Full Length Version Verse]
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run
[Chorus 2]
Out through the back door of Rosa's, I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one, it looked like it could run
Up on its back and away, I did ride

[Post-Chorus]
Just as fast as I could from
The West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico

[Verse 4]
Back in El Paso, my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

[Chorus 3]
I saddled up and away, I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow, a bullet may find me
Tonight, nothing's worse than this pain in my heart

[Verse 5]
And at last, here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Feleena, I go
[Verse 6]
Off to my right, I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's back door

[Chorus 4]
Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride

[Verse 7]
But my love for Feleena is strong and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

[Outro]
From out of nowhere, Feleena has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Feleena, goodbye11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",country

Never, have I ever, been a size ten in my whole life

I just came to see, what you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it, even though Katy, told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, mmm
Don't understand it, blood on your hands
And still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why, oh

Mmm, that's what my friends are calling me when
They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me ""Let go, he is not the one""
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it
Scheming and cheating, oh girl, why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right
Telling me this, I don't wanna listen
But you insist on repeatedly tryna tell me lies
And I just don't know why

This is for the ones who believe their lives won't change
Hoping that someday things will mend and be the same
And this is for the ones who have lost it all and all that's left to gain
Is a simple reminder that the things that were blind to slip away
How can I say, say I'll be okay?

And if I fall through these days that go by without cause
Just a painful mistake has left me here on my own
And if I fall through these nights I can't seem to go on
Just a sign that you're with me gives me the strength to hold on

Now that the lines been broken
I'm too afraid to just look back
The pages have left an empty space
You were all I had
Why does it have to be this way
These things they'll never change
Still I'm left with knowing, content and happy, this is all I need

834,Amos Lee,"Keep It Loose, Keep It Tight",relaxed,"Well I walked over the bridge
Into the city where I live
And I saw my old landlord
Well we both said, ""Hello""
There was no where else to go
'Cause his rent I couldn't afford

Well relationships change
Though I think its kind of strange
How money makes a man grow
Ah, some people they claim
If you get enough fame
You live over the rainbow, over the rainbow

But the people on the street
Out on buses or on feet
We all got the same blood flow
Oh in society every dollar got a deed
We all need a place that we can go
And feel over the rainbow

Sometimes we forget what we got
Who we are or who we are not
I think we got a chance to make it right
Keep it loose, keep it tight, keep it tight
I'm in love with a girl who's in love with the world
Though I cant help but follow
Though I know someday she is bound to go away
And stay over the rainbow
Got to learn how to let her go
Over the rainbow

But sometimes we forget who we got
Who they are or who they are not
There is so much more in love than black and white
Keep it loose child, gotta keep tight
Keep it loose, keep it tight, keep it tight
Keep it tight, yeahEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",pop

Maybe you're a sinner into your alternate life
Maybe you're a joker, maybe you deserve to die

If you cannot give me that then maybe I should step

But at this point walking away is the best thing we can do

Our life is the greatest story never told

Were we meant to be man and wife?
The answer I don't know
Of life's many mystery's what intrigues me the most
Is who our children would have been
I guess we'll never know
Even as I walk away I'll always keep the hope
These eyes never saw you leavin
This heart is in need of some healing
These arms are letting you go
That's life

That's the way the story goes
Truth is every relationship is a lesson
Truth is I saw it coming but it hurts anyway
Truth is I'm not the reason you're so angry
Truth is you're not the reason I'm so passive
Truth is I've got to take back my power
Truth is

The reason why it hurts so bad
To walk away from you

These eyes I never saw you leavin
This heart my heart is in need of some healing

838,The Mountain Goats,So Desperate,sad,"[Verse 1]
We were parked in your car
In our neutral meeting place, the Episcopalian churchyard
I had things I’d been meaning to say
But in the dazzling winter sun that late I could feel them melt away

And through the warm radio static
I couldn’t hear my stage directions
And the fog on the windshield
Obscured our sad reflections

[Chorus]
I felt so desperate in your arms
I felt so desperate in your arms

[Verse 2]
We were parked near some trees
And the moonlight soaked the branches in ever-deepening degrees
Had my hand in your hair
Trying to keep my cool ‘til it became too much to bear

When we cracked the windows open
Well the air was just so sweet
We could hear the cars ten feet away
Out there on the street
[Chorus x2]

It's late, so look straight
Don't pull your eyes off the ground
You sit and wait across the gate
The minutes stretch themselves so long
You'll never be my destiny
Because my destination's wrong

Right coast, left coast
Drifting round and round
I'm lost, always
And I know I can't be found

Who made these customs I can't seem to get past?
It's no use, since you've been born
Into a higher class
When I want you, and only you
Somehow your baggage comes along
And it never stops, no, it never stops
Until I'm back where I belong

Right coast, wrong coast
Drifting round and round
I'm lost, always
And I know I can't be found
You can't see me
Across this great divide
I'm lost, always
If I'm not right by your side

854,Thea Gilmore,Whistle And Steam,relaxed,"Its been a long time since I've seen you
Just like this, face to face
And I know I should have called you
But I had another ghost to chase
Should've read your letters
Should've found out how you'd been
But the truth is there was no escape
The call of whistle and steam
Of whistle and steam

There's a man down at the station
On a newspaper bed
""I just need some kind of salvation
Before I die"" he said
But honey we're just passers-by
In another leaving scene
You and I are locked in tight
To the call of whistle and steam
Of whistle and steam
Of whistle and steam

It's the sleepers and the steel
Or the black-root and the vine
But my place is the space between
The past and the horizon line
Can you hear that old horn blowin'
Every time you close your eyes?
And behind every bolted door
Is there a voice you recognise?
Singing prayers, singing curses
Singing all about the dream
To everyone caught in the headlights
Caught in the whistle and steam
In the whistle and steam
Caught in the whistle and steam
In the whistle and steam
In the whistle and steam

Caught in the whistle and steam
In the whistle and steamEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",folk/acoustic

[Verse 1]
You can tell
From the scars on my arms
And cracks in my hips
And the dents in my car
And the blisters on my lips
That I'm not the carefullest of girls
You can tell
From the glass on the floor
And the strings that're breaking
And I keep on breaking more
And it looks like I am shaking
But it's just the temperature
And then again
If it were any colder I could disengage
If I were any older I would act my age
But I don't think that you'd believe me
It's not the way I'm meant to be
It's just the way the operation made me

[Verse 2]
And you can tell
From the state of my room
That they let me out too soon
And the pills that I ate
Came a couple years too late
And I've got some issues to work through
There I go again
Pretending to be you
Make-believing
That I have a soul beneath the surface
Trying to convince you
It was accidentally on purpose
[Chorus]
I am not so serious
This passion is a plagiarism
I might join your century
But only on a rare occasion
I was taken out
Before the labor pains set in and now
Behold the world's worst accident
I am the girl anachronism

[Verse 3]
And you can tell
By the red in my eyes
And the bruises on my thighs
And the knots in my hair
And the bathtub full of flies
That I'm not right now at all
There I go again
Pretending that I'll fall
Don't call the doctors
Cause they've seen it all before
They'll say just
Let her crash and burn, she'll learn
The attention just encourages her

[Verse 4]
And you can tell
From the full-body cast
That you're sorry that you asked
Though you did everything you could
Like any decent person would
But I might be catching so don't touch
You'll start believing you're immune to gravity and stuff
Don't get me wet
Because the bandages will all come off
[Bridge]
You can tell
From the smoke at the stake
That the current state is critical
Well it is the little things, for instance:
In the time it takes to break it she can make up ten excuses:
Please excuse her for the day
It's just the way the medication makes her

[Chorus]
I don't necessarily believe there is a cure for this
So I might join your century but only as a doubtful guest
I was too precarious removed as a caesarian
Behold the world's worst accident:
I am the girl anachronism (I am the girl anachronism)
I am the girl anachronism (I am the girl anachronism)
I am the girl (I am the girl)

Only to vanish in the spring
It never fails to make him shiver
To see the outline of her wings

Where she made her last snow angel
Little did they know
That it’d make a lasting impression
Deeper than the snow
In his soul, snow angel never faded

And when love calls to make that promise
One to be faithful and be true
It’s then temptation falls upon us
The world turns awkward and aloof

And with this betrayal
An angel descended from on high
Oh, but this was not a manger
And as he came inside to his fright
T’was no angel hanging naked

Strange how each year ‘round late November
When the first snow is on the ground
She reappears so he’ll remember
How a love so young can be cut down?
When she made her last snow angel
Little did they know
That it’d make a lasting impression
Deeper than the snow

Yo, tuna the smoke-jumper, packin' my oral cannon
Bustin' from Okinawa, Japan to Laurel Canyon
Swallow flows, we turning like plush tires

Spreading vocal leprosy using discrepancy
Lyric weaponry lessens your chances of testing me
Stop and freeze MC's, I block atrocities
True philosophies from the lips of black Socrates

The pocket-penciler in your peninsula
Killing Dracula MC's who bit from my vernacular
I can back it, the ill scene we occupy
No lullaby, got you high, when I rock a fly

Verse, for my people, let me breath slow
Give a heave-ho, and stimulate your cerebral system
Cut Chemist grip the fader with Tuna the group debater
We murder you duplicators, 'cause I'm an aristocrat, ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with the gift for rap it's like that rocks da house

I, the aristocrat, ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with the gift for rap, it's like that rocks da house
Yo they call me Mister Antagonistic, drastic
Comin' from a place where these cops get their ass kicked
The last trick unified was the cornerstone
A lyric pistol to the dome is how we warn a clone
Born alone, the strength of god makes my mission higher
They found the liar dead, strung up with fishin' wire

The mystifier packin' vocal artillery
Makin' lovely word connections like Chuck Woolery
The cool in me, I'll make your block turn on one rhyme
Electrifyin' like some nocturnal sunshine

The planetary pioneer and his mixer
Cut chemist Chali tuna spittin' scriptures
Paintin' pictures even sisters adapt 'cause
We take it back like chiropractors
Fuckin' actors on wax make worse for real
Mc's who worth your while and so they search for me

The aristocrat, ghetto diplomat

And I'm blessed with the gift for rap it's like that rocks da house
Should I let, should I let aha, one two, one, two, check it

Yo should I let ya know
Should I mention that you lost a vital part of your body
In competition with the T to the you 'n' Ah, the bread winner
Lyrical lead spinner, that's hittin' you dead center

Without trying to be somebody you're not

Don't let them tell you it rocks
It's all about what your wear, the color of your hair
And how many tatoos you got on your arm
So how did we get here where'd it all go wrong?
Flying through the airwaves coming into your home
All the suits in Hollywood are gonna roll in all the dough

Tell me that you need it tell me that you feel it this is the new sensation
Come on and just try it you know you can't fight it this is gonna sweep the
Nation

I think back to this day when all the bands used to play
Without giving a shit about what was in
Now it has changed scenes rearranged
Let's start it over again
What really matters to me is so easy to see
It's staring us right in the face
We gotta put it behind get back in line
We gotta save this dying race

And so tenderly  'till the feeling overflows
When you look at me, I go soft and cave in
And I can't conceal that I'm slowly weakening

Spin around inside my head unendingly

You must think first before you move
Toad style is immensely strong
And immune to nearly any weapon
When it's properly used it's almost invincible
[Verse 1: U-God]
Raw I'ma give it to ya
With no trivia
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia
My Hip-Hop will rock and shock the nation
Like the Emancipation Proclamation
Weak MC's
Approach with slang that's dead
You might as well run into the wall and bang your head
I'm pushin' force
My force you're doubtin'
I'm makin' devils cower to the Caucasus Mountains

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Well, I'm a sire
I set the microphone on fire
Rap styles vary
And carry like Mariah
I come from the Shaolin slum
And the isle I'm from
Is comin' through with nuff niggas
And nuff guns
So if you wanna come sweatin'
Stressin', contestin'
You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Don't talk the talk
If you can't walk the walk
Phony niggas are outlined in chalk
I'm mad vexed
It's what the projects made me
Rebel to the grain, there's no way to barricade me
Steamrollin' niggas like an 18 wheeler with a drunk driver drivin'
There's no survivin'

Rough like Timberland wear
Yeah!

Peace to all the crooks

Nickel-plated MAC's
Black AC's
Drug-dealin' styles in phat stacks
I only been a good nigga for a minute though
'Cause I got to get my props

Lampin' in a Lexus, eatin' beef

Keep the pockets stacked and then
Hands clap and then
At the party when I move my body
Gotta get up and be somebody!
Grab the microphone, put strength

No, it's the God, get the shit right
Mega trife, and yo, I killed you in a past life
On the mic while you was kickin' that fast shit
You reneged, tried again and got blasted
Half-mastered-ass style, mad ruff task
When I struck I had on Timbs and a black mask
Remember that shit?
I know you don't remember jack
That night, yo I was hittin' like a spiked bat
Until you thought I was bugged out and crazy
Strapped for nonsense
After me became lazy
Yo, nobody budge while I shot slugs
Never shot thugs

What justifies the homicide

Looks like the work of a master
Evidence indicates that his stature
Merciless like a terrorist hard to capture

Changes like a chameleon
Plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
This technique attacks the immune system
Disguised like a lie, paralysin' the victim
You scream

Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
Movin' on a nigga with the speed of a centipede

882,Cradle of Filth,Lovesick for Mina,angry,"One might see in Mina
My disease
But it was She who has infected me
For all eternity...

As the sun slips the tearaway stars
Into the scented scheme of night
I kissed her mouth like a dark red rose
Set upon a marbled dream of white
So pure of thought like a Vestal statue
Jewelled with a God-lent grace
I was close to coming when she bid adieu
Fuelled by heartache rent upon her face there

Oh Mina, obscener
Thoughts obsess my days
Oh Mina, obscener
Thoughts possess me
That I must now obey

They say the darkest hour
Is that before the dawn
When nothing in one's power
Can dissipate the great forlorn
Shadows of fire that haunt me
Like risen whispers of her name
For dawn is a dusk
Wherein needs must
Erupt from the grave, aflame

Written in the dead of night
And riding on the burning wind
Smitten by her read delight
My words alight like leave of sin

Stepping through a mirror
The princess of the emerald glass
Brought me on sip nearer
Love's infernal past...

They say Hell hath no furies
Like a woman scorned by life
When the Heavenly Judge and juries
Participate to chain this wife
With forced virtue, Her secret needs
On warm we nights, with storm-wracked bites
I gave her Eden after the flood

Written in the dead of night
And riding on the burning wind
Smitten by her read delight
My words alight like leaves of sin
Verona, Marishka, Aleera
Brides of old and goddesses all
Forgive my wishes to be always near her
Forever or whenever seas recall

The Aphrodite from my embrace
For as Mars (whom her lips placate)
I tore these shores with wars of hatred
Before our Paris wet his fate
In Helen, one might find mistake
In winning tragedy
For all eternity...

I am still lovesick for Mina
I am still so lovesick for MinaEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",metal
883,Lily Allen,Friday Night,happy,"[Verse 1]
Friday night, last orders at the pub
Get in the car and drive to the club
There's a massive crowd outside, so we get into the queue
It's quarter past eleven now, we won't get in 'til quarter to

[Verse 2]
It's quarter to and we get to the front
Girl on the guest list dressed like a cunt
She asked security to check inside my shoes
You can play this game with me, but you know you're gonna lose

[Pre-Chorus]
Looked me up and down
I don't make a sound
There's a lesson that I want you to learn
Is if you're gonna play with fire, then you're gonna get burned

[Chorus]
Don't try and test me, 'cause you'll get a reaction
Another drink and I'm ready for action
I don't know who you think you are
But making people scared won't get you very far

[Verse 3]
In the club, make our way to the bar
Good dancing, love, but you should've worn a bra
Guy on the mic, and he's making too much noise
There's these girls in the corner, want attention from the boys
[Verse 4]
I see these girls and they're shouting through the crowd
Don't understand why they're being really loud
Make their way over to me and try and push me out the way
I push her back, she looks at me, and says, 'What ya tryna say?'

[Pre-Chorus]
Looked me up and down
I don't make a sound
There's a lesson that I want you to learn
Is if you're gonna play with fire, then you're gonna get burned

[Chorus]
Don't try and test me, 'cause you'll get reaction
Another drink and I'm ready for action
I don't know who you think you are
But making people scared won't get you very far
Don't try and test me, 'cause you'll get reaction

884,Sandi Thom,What If I'm Right,happy,"One, two, three, four
You'll take me on a journey
And be there till the end
It won't be an uphill struggle
On you I can depend

You promised me a dream home
With roses round the door
You'll cover me in diamonds
There's nothing I want more
And
You'll be strong
And you'll turn me on
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
You'll be true and be faithful too
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
What if I'm right?

'cos if the rain starts falling
You'll protect me with your coat
And you'll always tape the football
And let me watch my soap

You'll always be as handsome
And your weight will never gain
And when I give birth to our children
I will feel no pain
And
You'll bring me flowers
And you'll bring the showers
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
You'll say I'm thin and bring the washing in
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
What if I'm right?
You'll always keep the magic
The tender love and care
And when you need to change the light bulb
You won't hand me the chair
And when we're tired of the city
And we find a country home
You'll sell your vinyl records
And go get us a loan

You'll be my sympathetic lover
And won't steal the covers
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
You won't forsake me
Your mother won't hate me
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
You'll be strong
And you'll turn me on
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?

Sometimes I feel like I'm not that strong
Sometimes I feel so frail so small
Sometimes I feel vulnerable
Sometimes I feel a little fragile
A little fragile

In six thousand years what will this mean
Words from the heart or a melody
So caught in emotion and I'm overcome
As I'm falling down I come undone

Sometimes I feel like I'm alone
Sometimes I feel like I'm not that strong
Sometimes I feel nothing at all
Sometimes I feel vulnerable
Sometimes I feel a little fragile

If people can see right through my eyes
Like an open door that I can't disguise
I won't be afraid from the tears I cry
I'll not run I'll not hide this is how I feel inside

To burn your places of worship
And our gods shall become your gods
All that lives on the vine is rotten
May your wines be foul
And your bread as the flesh of the dead
An ill wind to bring nought but decay
And the stench of your slaughtered kin
Your slaughtered kin
Dead
The stench of your slaughtered kin

Every last one of you
The newborn, borne with fear in their eyes
And slavery in their limbs
As tools to build a new empire

저리 가 비켜라 몰라 가라
누구냐? 나다 나 나는 Redman
나보다 잘난~ 내~ 누구~ 나도~forget it
I rip shop in hip-hop, I get props, my lip rocks
The rap stuff's more spooky than movies from Hitchcock
Sit back relax let me rip to the funk track
And press rewind if I haven't blown your mind (Rewind)

And you blow my mind, baby
And you blow my mind, baby (Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind)
And you blow my mind, baby
And you blow my mind, baby (Press rewind if I—)

Let me get busy with the funky fly stuff
'Cause I cut your freakin' eyes out
Fuck Bruce Willis because I die rough
It's the Funkadelic Redman
And I hit ya with the Funkadelic level, the P-Funk, the devil
The spectacular, Blacula, bust holes like Dracula
Load up a course more legend than Acura
I'm swift, I like big spliffs so I tisk tisk a tasket
Plus keep the Glock in my basket
I cough up a lung 'cause I freak it with the tongue
'Cause I can wax on, wax off like Daniel-san
Do the yea yea, boogey say up jump the boogey
To the boogey to the boogey
Thanks to E 'cause he hooked me
So fuck what ya heard, word to Herb
'Cause I mac-a-frama-lama
Plus I kick the grammar, straight from New Jers
It's the renegade rap Redman, really who rip rhymes in rough mode
Yo, hold your breath while I explode

900,Scott Walker,If You Go Away,sad,"[Verse 1]
If you go away, on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
And the day was young and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the night bird's song

[Refrain]
If you go away, if you go away
If you go away

[Chorus]
But, if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain
And talk to the trees, and worship the wind
Then if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand

[Refrain]
If you go away, if you go away
If you go away

[Verse 2]
If you go away, as I know you will
You must tell the world to stop turning, turning
'Til you return again, if you ever do
For what good is love without loving you?
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly, till the next hello
[Refrain]
If you go away, if you go away
If you go away

[Chorus]
But, if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll glide on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much
But, if you go, I won't cry
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye

[Refrain]
If you go away, if you go away
If you go away

[Verse 3]
If you go away, as I know you must
There'd be nothing left in this world to trust
Just an empty room full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
And I'd have been the shadow of your shadow
If you might have kept me by your side

[Refrain]
If you go away, if you go away
If you go away1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",pop

In coastal towns like this
Waiting for my world to cave under
We seem to invent ourselves
In places left unknown
If hope could only find me out

This is the end of everything I am

Broken hearts like promises
Are left for lesser knowns
Is anybody out there? Alone, Alone
Because the coldest winters thrive

Depression is the unholy ghost
In the coastal town ahead
Though I know a thousand names
I seem my only friend

I've got the gun, all I need is ten cents for the bullet
I feel helpless, sleeping at best. Waiting for your return
Are you ever coming home?

Is anybody out there? Hello, hello
Broken hearts like promises are left for lesser knowns
Is anybody out there? Alone, alone
Because the coldest winters thrive on broken homes. (Broken Homes)

Is anybody out there? Alone alone
For lesser known

Little sister don't you worry about a thing today
Take the heat from the sun
Little sister
I know that everything is not ok
But you're like honey on my tongue

[Pre-Chorus 1]
True love never can be rent
But only true love can keep beauty innocent

[Chorus 1]
I could never take a chance
Of losing love to find romance
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

No I could never take a chance
'Cause I could never understand
The mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

[Verse 2]
You can run from love
And if it's really love it will find you
Catch you by the heel
But you can't be numb for love
The only pain is to feel nothing at all
How can I hurt when I'm holding you?
[Chorus 2]
I could never take a chance
Of losing love to find romance
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

And you're the one, there's no-one else
It makes me want to lose myself
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

[Bridge]
Brown eyed girl across the street
On rue Saint Divine
I thought this is the one for me
But she was already mine
You were already mine

Little sister
I've been sleeping in the street again
Like a stray dog
Little sister
I've been trying to feel complete again
But you're gone and so is God

The soul needs beauty for a soul mate
When the soul wants, the soul waits

[Chorus 3]
I could never take a chance
Of losing love to find romance
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

For love and faith and sex and fear
And all the things that keep us here
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

Six questions you must answer me
And I will ask them all
And you and I in the bed might lie
Roll me over next to the wall

And higher than the trees?
And what is worse than a woman's curse
And what is deeper than the sea?
What bird sings first, which one's best?
Where does the dew first fall
And you and I in a bed might lie
Roll me over next to the wall
Roll me over next to the wall
The earth is rounder than a ring
And heaven is higher than the trees
The devil is worse than a woman's curse
And hell in deeper than the sea
The lark sings first, the thrush sings best
Earth is where the dew falls
And you and I in a bed must lie
Roll me over next to the wall
Roll me over next to the wall

He takes her by her lily-white hand
And leads her down the hall
And he takes her by her slender waist
For fear that she might fall
And he lays her on a bed of down
Without a doubt at all

Roll me over next to the wall
And she and he lie in one bed

I'm pinned against the bed
A stethoscope upon my heart
A hand against my head
They're peeling off the bandages
I'm wincing in the light
The nurse is looking anxious
And she's quivering with fright
Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes x4
The doctors are avoiding me
My vision is confused
I listen to my earphones
And I catch the evening news
A murderer's been killed
And he donates his sight to science
I'm locked into a private ward
I realise that I must be
Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes x4

I smash the light in anger
Push my bed against the door
I close my lids across the eyes
And wish to see no more
The eye receives the messages
And sends them to the brain
No guarantee the stimuli
Must be perceived the same way
Looking through Gary Gilmore´s eyes x4

Gary don´t need his eyes to see
Gary and his eyes have parted companyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",metal

914,Bright Eyes,Classic Cars,relaxed,"She was a real royal lady, true patron of the arts
She said the best country singers die in the back of classic cars
So if I ever got too hungry for a suitcase or guitar
To think of them all alone in the dark
So I laid some nights beside her in a bed made for a queen
She said I kissed her different, that all the men her age were mean
Gave me anything I wanted, oh the generosity
I took all that I could, it was free

Now the sky's a torn-up denim and the clouds are just splattered paint
It's a room I'm renovating; it's a name I got to change
If I get out of California, I'm going back to my home state
To tell them all that I made a mistake

And I keep looking for that blindfold faith
Lighting candles to a cynical saint
Who wants the last laugh at the fly trapped in the windowsill tape
You can go right out of your mind trying to escape
From the panicked paradox of day to day
If you can't understand something then it's best to be afraid
The whole world it loves you if you're a chic chameleon
Intersecting circles, she could hang with anyone
But when conducting business she would lie about where she's from
Saying, ""Life is how it is not how it was""
I learned to listen, felt like I was back at school
She'd talk forever about the phases of the moon
Saying, ""Everything is a cycle, you've got to let it come to you
And when it does, you will know what to do""

Without even knowing, I guess I took up her advice
Painted her front door, it seemed a suitable goodbye
It's not that often but I think of her sometimes
Just something quaint, a couple ships in the night

And they keep moving at a glacial pace
Turning circles in a memory maze
I made a new cast of the death mask that's gonna cover my face
I had to change the combination to the safe
Hide it all behind a wall, let people wait
And never trust a heart that's so bent it can't break1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

921,Jimmy Durante,I'M The Guy Who Found The Lost Chord,happy,"I was sitting at my piano, the other day
But my mind was ill at ease
They were coming to take it away that afternoon
I was all by myself in a mellow mood
Improvising symphonies
My right hand was playing Mozart's minuet
And at the same time my left hand was playing; have a banana; from Carmen
And at the same time my mouth was whistling a sextet from Luicini
And at the same time What do you think my foot was doing?
While keeping time it was cracking walnuts; see I had to eat too
Then in the midst of all soliloquy
I found it, I found it
The Lost Chord, The Lost Chord!
So let's celebrate I'm feeling great
I'm the guy that found the Lost chord
I'll have my name in the hall of fame; cos I went and found that lost chord

Everyone knows Tchaikovsky wasn't recognised for 300 years
Brahms wasn't recognised for 400 years
Beethoven wasn't recognised for 500 years
But I can't wait that long I've only got two changes of clothes!

People said I was mad. but that didn't trouble me
They said Mozart was mad
They said Puccini was mad
They said Louis was mad
Who's Louis? My uncle, he was mad!
So let's celebrate I'm feeling great
I'm the guy that found the Lost chord

You know it wasn't easy finding that Lost chord
Working in my attic I didn't sleep for days and days
I'd be in terrible shape if I hadn't slept nights!
First I put an A flat with a B minor
Then I put a B minor with and F major
Then I put and F minor with a B major
Then I tried an A and a B and a B and a C
And a C and a D and a D and E and an E and a F
And a F and a G; What a piano no apostrophe's !

And this is what I came up with (plays wrong chord)

What's happened that isn't the chord (plays wrong chord)
Neither is that (plays wrong chord)
Neither is that (plays wrong chord)
And neither is that! I lost the chord a catatstrophe
I'm gonna sit down on the keyboard of this piano until the chord is return

(sits down bum plays the right chord)

That's it the lost chord! I found it, I found by sitting on the piano keyboard
Strange I usually play by ear!
So let's celebrate I'm feeling great
I'm the guy that found the Lost chordEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",easy listening

There is nothing else in the world
I'd rather wake up and see with you
Beautiful dawn, I'm just chasing time again
Thought I would die a lonely man, in endless night
But now I'm high running wild among all the stars above
Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me
Beautiful, dawn melt with the stars again
Do you remember the day when my journey began?
Will you remember the end of time?
Beautiful dawn, you're just blowing my mind again
Thought I was born to endless night, until you shine
High running wild among all the stars above
Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me
Will you be my shoulder when I'm gray and older?
Promise me tomorrow starts with you

926,Lucinda Williams,Broken Butterflies,sad,"You wear your anger well and stand
For all the world to see
A heavy cloak and one gloved hand
And no humility

You stand inside the garden
And feast on black cherries
And swallow the manna from heaven
And spit out the seeds

You spread your anger on sharp-edged knives
Cut my skin and make it bleed
Like Pilate in his self-righteousness
You're a traitor and a thief

Choking on your unplanned words
Coughing up your lies
Tumbling from your mouth a flurry
Of broken butterflies

But the blood that flows I cannot hide
That blood that covers me
Nourishes the butterflies
And they are healed and are set free

I wish you had what Ruth possessed
But then I don't expect that of you
Grace and honor and faithfulness
And the love that you refuse
Will you ever learn to just forgive
Will you open your beautiful eyes
And bleed the way Christ did
And fix the broken butterfliesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",country

And they say it's the fairest of all
Of course you protest, that's what you do best
And you're modest and shy to the end
You're watching them as they're looking at you
And you know it was money well spent

And you tried to get into the Bible

It sounds so foolish if I even try
Love is an arrow and it points at you
It tells you what you gotta do

Love is a verb and a noun as well
You find it in a dictionary under 'L'
To give you a description to spell it out
But they don't say what it's all about

Love is a fire that you can't control
It burns in the middle and it leaves a hole
You can fill it up and you don't know when
It's gonna start to burn again

Love is a good way to lose a friend
It's a two-faced liar that you can't defend
Love is a virus that invades your heart
It starts to take it all apart

Love is a shape that you can't define
With an odd set of angles and uneven sides
Your head's that paper and your hearts the pen
Gonna do this sum again
Gonna do this sum again
Gonna do this sum again

To haunt of the wide earth a spot
To which I could not love the less
So lovely was the loneliness

Of a wild lake, with black rock bound
And the tall trees that towered around

But when the night had thrown her pall
Upon that spot as upon all
And the wind would pass me by
In its stilly melody

My infant spirit would awake
To the terror of the lone lake
My infant spirit would awake
To the terror of the lone lake

Yet that terror was not fright
But a tremulous delight
And a feeling undefined
Springing from a darkened mind

Death was in that poisoned wave
And in its gulf, a fitting grave
For him who thence could solace bring
To his dark imagining
Whose wildering thought could even make
An Eden of that dim lake

But when the night had thrown her pall
Upon that spot as upon all
And the wind would pass me by
In its stilly melody

My infant spirit would awake
To the terror of the lone lake
My infant spirit would awake
To the terror of the lone lake
My infant spirit would awake
To the terror of the lake

Springing from a darkened mind

Enshrined in downing deep
The mourn abandoned plains
Laid down in sombre sleep
Misty shades engulf the sky
Like past, worn memories
The bird's song fills the whispering breeze
With autumns melody

The lunar pale grim shape
At evening's sight renews
It's silented wail relieves
Repressed thoughts anew
I hear the lonesome choir
Of fortunes past my way
Disdained in fiery weeps
Throughout my every day
These skies I hail and treasure thee
Most pleasant misery
Not pittes thorn I shelter thine
Mysterious harmony

Draw on most pleasant night
Shade my lorn exposed sight
For my grief's when shadows told
Shall be eased in mist enfold
Why should the foolish's hope
Thy unborn passioned cry
Exhaust unheard
Beneath this pleasent sky?
For if the dusking day declined
Could delight be far behind?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",metal

The last time I saw Richard was Detroit in '68
And he told me, ""All romantics meet the same fate someday
Cynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark café
""You laugh,"" he said, ""you think you're immune
Go look at your eyes, they're full of moon
You like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you
All those pretty lies, pretty lies
When you gonna realize they're only pretty lies?
Only pretty lies, just pretty lies""

[Verse 2]
He put a quarter in the Wurlitzer
And he pushed three buttons and the thing began to whirr
And a bar maid came by in fishnet stockings and a bow tie
And she said ""Drink up now, it's gettin' on time to close.""
""Richard, you haven't really changed,"" I said, it's just that
Now you're romanticizing some pain that's in your head
You got tombs in your eyes, but the songs you punched are dreamy
Listen, they sing of love so sweet, love so sweet
When you gonna get yourself back on your feet?
Oh and love can be so sweet, love so sweet

[Verse 3]
Richard got married to a figure skater
And he bought her a dishwasher and a coffee percolator
And he drinks at home now most nights with the TV on
And all the house lights left up bright
I'm gonna blow this damn candle out
I don't want nobody comin' over to my table
I got nothing to talk to anybody about
All good dreamers pass this way someday
Hidin' behind bottles in dark cafés
Dark cafés, only a dark cocoon
Before I get my gorgeous wings and fly away

To purify the ignorance that hides the sun
The less you understand the more you're driven

Packaged and processed the masses are force fed
The standards they judge us on swallow the rot we shed

Open wide and eat the worms of the enemy
We are the enemies of reality, in a world that's unforgiving

Breathing dust and decay while I'm sipping
Human trust and betrayal
Losing faith once again
Take my hand my friend, my foe, I am enemy

Open wide and eat the worms of the enemy
We are the enemies of reality, in a world that's unforgiving
Open wide, eat the words, become what you most fear1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",metal

Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd float down to the sea
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd say just what you please
Without the sticky little kitten
Your ticket could never be free

Without the tight little denim
Your virtues would all go unknown
Without the room that you live in
Your cancer would eat to the bone
Your muscles would bulge underground
Your demons would all be around
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me

Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd burn all these dying leaves
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd lift this steaming herd
You would kill all the sick ones
You would bury them deep in the earth

Something's coming over me

Whoa!

Part 2: Black Friday

Killer, intruder, a homicidal man
If you see me coming, run fast as you can
Bloodthirsty demon who's stalking the street
I hack up my victims like pieces of meat
Bloodthirsty demon, sinister fiend
Bludgenous slaughter's my evil deed

My hammer's a cold piece of blood-lethal steel
I grin while you writhe with the pain that I deal
Swinging the hammer, I hack through their heads
Deviant defilers, you're next to be dead
I unleash my hammer with sadistic intent
Pounding, surrounding, slamming through your head
Yeah!

[Verse 4]
Bodies convulse in agony and pain
I mangle their faces, 'til no features remain
A blade for the butchering, I cut them to shreds
First take out the organs, then cut off the head
The remains of the flesh now sop under my feet
One more bloody massacre, the murder's complete
I seek to dismember, a sadist fiend
Bloodbath's my way of gettin' clean

[Verse 5]
I lurk in the alley, wait for the kill
I have no remorse for the blood that I spill
A merciless butcher who lives underground
I'm out to destroy and I will cut you down
Cut you down
I see you, and I'm waiting for Black Friday

It's all a matter of soul and fire
Infatuation or true desire
The thrill of discovery, divine intervention
Cruel, cruel change, pain of rejection

[Verse 2]
As you walk away, think of all the joy we shared
If you decide you need me, I'll be wondering if I care
Not there to soothe your soul, friend to tender friend
I think our love is coming to an end

[Verse 3]
King persuader, congratulations
You share her heart, you bought her soul
Princess confusion, come to me again
Saying goodbye was so much fun

[Verse 4]
When you walk away, feel the freedom in your heart
There's a joy in letting go, free to find a love apart
When I lose control, I need a kind, forgiving friend
But I think our love is coming to an end
I know our love is coming to an end1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

Lost sight of everything tonight
My presence blackens their pattern
A pock in the healthy and calm

Their scorn behind your back
My promise would put them down
No trace of reverence left
Immemorial fire in their eyes

I would perish at the given signal
At the slightest touch from my soul
Tainted prophet in flesh
For all the plagued and lost

[Verse 4]
Dripping sin, decision in stalemate
Dare to feel death at hand
Surprised me with its voice
Through the forest came the morn

[Verse 5]
Across the leafy pathway, their deeds smeared in blood
For all to behold the Council of the Cross
Must have sensed my coming, the pest through the air
With despise for squalor lashing out at the poor
[Verse 6]
I turned away my eyes
In pallor escape from the end
Fading time to leave from here
And less to fulfill my task
She would be safe and firm
Nothing of this is in vain
Taken away from stifling grace
And saved from the past2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",metal

There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow

And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow

Birds fly over the rainbow

Though summer's over now
There's a strange new music in the street

You and I
Know the world can't be like this
It's our love that makes it shine

Girl
Whatever trouble waits outside these doors
We're safe inside this house of light
We make up our own storyline

Around the neighborhood
They stare and grin
As if they live their lives
Just to help maintain the state we're in
But when we fight
Then those hungry wolves close in
We're one thoughtless word away

From poison skies
And severed heads
And pain and lies
So follow me
I'll hold you tight
And we'll build a life together
In the great pagoda of funn
This magic soon will fade
Without a doubt
We'll have to work my love
Just to keep the flame from going out
Cause if we fail
Then these walls will fall away
And we'll find we're in the realm

Of psycho-moms
And dying stars
And dirty bombs
Please follow me
And hold me tight
Yes we'll build a world together

952,Jens Lekman,Friday Night at the Drive-In Bingo,happy,"[Verse 1]
In a tiny, tiny southern Swedish country town
Two acres of field and a gas station
Riding on my moped, looking for fun
Staring into the blood red sun
On the country road is a boulevard
With neon lights and night open bars
In my jacket a pack of playing cards
Just jacks, jokers, and the queen of hearts

[Chorus]
My heart is beating
Beating like Ringo
As I pull into the drive-in bingo

[Verse 2]
Why do the people in the country want to look like the people in the city
When the people in the city aren't the slightest pretty?
I want the people in the country to wear flannel shirts and saggy jeans all covered in dirt
I want the people in the country to be open and kind
But most times I've met those with a narrow mind
With a big black dog to bite your behind
If they ever find out you're not one of their kind

[Chorus]
All these thoughts as I open up a Zingo
Friday night at the drive-in bingo
[Bridge]
So this is what they do out here for fun?
They play bingo and let their engines run?
Tonight's jackpot is a pig, hey that's criminal!
G-42! Ooh, I'm going diagonal!
I'm gonna gather up a few of my friends
As many fits into an army tent
Just bring our savings and a bottle of wine
To the Friday night's reversal of time!

[Verse 3]
This little south-west village shouldn't cost that much
Maybe a handful of silver or a hundred bucks
We could have wild, wild parties in that big old lodge
And the windmill's perfect for movies and such
We could fake our deaths to get insurance money
And take on hippie names, I'd be Snowphish, you'd be Sunny
We could start a little farm with little white bunnies
Just because watching them copulate is very funny
There's a cow and an ostrich just waiting for you!
A glass of apple cider just waiting for you!
The smell of 1952 just waiting for you!
And all I'm doing here is just waiting for you...

And make you holla still
I gotta pay my bills and it's not like Prada will

Hopefully radio plays this I doubt it though
Yo pass that Olde English

Premieres openings and shows and such but
What else is a girl to do

I'm doin the same stupid shit and it's day in day out
I know that there's gotta be a way out
But I keep drinking and I just stay out
At the hot spots with superstars and the hardrocks
I wish that I could disappear to the boondocks
Why not, maybe I'll hire me a pilot
To take me away to the shade and I'll stay
Get a slice at Ray's like we did when we was kids
Something's gotta give real soon but it's not this

It's like maybe tonight's the night and
Maybe if I socialize I'll feel alright but those
Never seem to be the best laid plans
Never did I dream I'd go to foreign lands I just
Wanna lay in creamy sands
Doing nothin all day with my dreamy man maybe
Buy that house across from the projects
So I can stay trading gossip like stock tips

It's not at the after party

961,Mr. Hyde,Spill Your Blood,angry,"[Intro 1: American Psycho sample]
It's not good any more, it's a cash bar, $25
You're a fucking ugly bitch
I want to stab you to death and then play around with your blood

[Intro 2: Necro]
Yo word up get the fucking mop
Ain't bout to leave all your fucking blood on the floor
Bitch we will..

[Hook: Necro]
Spill your blood on the concrete
Split your mug and let you leak
Holding guns and rolling deep
Psycho thugs you don't want beef

[Verse 1: Mr. Hyde]
When Mr. Hyde enters the room you'll reside inside a tomb
When I off you with the blade in a coffin's where you stay
There ain't a fucker rough enough or tough enough to step it
And God forbid you knuckle up you'll probably get snuffed to death
I'll Hook a right and a left my juks will spike in your flesh
But you received it like a man and took it right in your chest
Y'all are thinking that you're thugs I'ma split open your jugs
Rather spit at you with slugs than kick and get blood on my Lugs
Never acted fucking nice, like to hack and cut, and slice
If you front it's logical that I attack you with a knife
I stay strapped and shady cause I'm packing a 380
After life decision makers wanna banish me to Hades
But I'm still gripping the heat spraying off a pound of shells
Gonna need a thicker leash to restrain the hounds of hell
See my bloody fists'll drip then I'll add like 50 kicks
To your cranium I'm Damien with the biscuit itch
My whole crew is sick known to start some stupid shit
And if you disrespect you'll probably see a troop of kids
They'll be marching to your door strapping hard to start a war
They'll wait for my demand the command to spark the gore
[Hook: Necro]
Spill your blood on the concrete
Split your mug and let you leak
Holding guns and rolling deep
Psycho thugs you don't want beef

[Verse 2: Mr. Hyde]
My sick thoughts'll provoke a pitchfork in your throat
You'll get tossed in a moat your torn corpse didn't float
There's too many holes in it, your flesh and your clothes are ripped
From head to toes you're bit, food for the chosen fish
Shut up and slice it's time to cut up and dice
I'll drink every last gulp wasting blood isn't nice
When I'm going to the shortage of gawking to the slaughters
Just shed some fucking fluid and induce the Rigor Mortis
Your pulse rate'll cease as I'm unloadin' my shotty
Then wait for the police to come and catch a boneless body
It's a bad afternoon when you're stabbed with the spoon
Jab 'til ya wounds filter laughter, it's June
I'm trudging through blood with guts stuck in my Timbs
After my bludgeoning blood saws and cut off your limbs
You can beg me but earnestly your life ain't concerning me
The crimson and burgundy you drip for eternity

[Hook: Necro]
Spill your blood on the concrete
Split your mug and let you leak
Holding guns and rolling deep
Psycho thugs you don't want beef
[Outro: Mr. Hyde]
Yo that's right you little fucking bitches it's Mr. Hyde in your grill
I'll spill your fucking blood
MCC will spill your fucking blood
Psycho+Logical spills your fuckin blood
Junkyard Dog will spill your fucking blood
Fat motherfucking Pat will spill your fucking blood

Wishing they weren't there
And as the microphone squeaks
A young girl's telephone beeps

Oh, she's running to the streets outside
""Oh, you've saved me,"" she screams down the line
""The band were fucking wank and I'm not having a nice time""

Shall pay the penalty of truth
A season of stolen youth
Shall teach old hearts to break

Here where the animals lay down to die
So we stood alone on a distant shore
Our broken spirits in rags and tatters
Nerve and muscle, heart and brains
Lost to Ireland, lost in vain
So you pause and you can almost hear
The sounds, they echo down through the ages
The creak of the burial cart
Here in humiliation and sorrow
Not mixed with indignation

So one is driven to exclaim
Oh god, that bread should be so dear
And human flesh so cheap

Young hearts are born with such grief
And we have paid the penalty of truth

With the parasite attached to me

Would divorce what was wed above

But league after league
It yet remained
For the fleshy vessel I
Kept it sustained
And so we froze a while surrounded by one big tear
Which only reminded me of a former home
But we weren't welcome
The sea made that clear
By filling us with saline
And sailing us blue blue back into
The atmosphere

""You choked as you surfaced, tangled in seaweed""

But what remained?
Of the driving intent?
That led me to tract such watery depths

But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop, glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I shoot back—fuck gettin' hit!
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it
'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon
Sent from the stars, sun and the moon
In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die with 9s out
This is what Nas is 'bout, nigga, the time is now!
[Chorus]
Yo, all I need is one mic
All I need is one mic (that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (all I need, niggas)
All I need is one mic (yeah)

[Verse 2]
All I need is one blunt, one page and one pen
One prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter of fact, maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me—fuck all of them!
Jesus died at age 33, there's 33 shots
From twin Glocks, there's 16 apiece, that's 32
Which means one of my guns was holdin' 17
27 hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggas roll up, shootin' from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, too many 9s
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way: they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now!
[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (that's all I need, niggas, that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (there's nothin' else in the world)
All I need is one mic (that's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know)
All I need is one mic (this is all I need)

[Verse 3]
All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is
Niggas'll move on you only if they know what your weakness is
I have none, too late to grab guns
I'm blastin' ‘cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards
Drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a cop'll get killed
Body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range
Niggas throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous ‘cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me ‘cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true
She came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace
Lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon ‘cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found
You need some soul-searchin', the time is now
[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
All I need is one mic (all I ever needed in this world, fuck cash)
All I need is one mic (fuck the cars, the jewelry)
All I need is one mic (to spread my voice to the whole world, baby)51EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",hip hop

Uh, yeah
Tell 'em how to sell it
It's propaganda

[Verse 1]
Don't tell me how to keep my composure
It ain't over till I get me some closure
Wanted dead or alive is my profile
Hostile is the frame for my state of grace
Severely a mental disorder
Where reality is highly distorted
Psychosis, weaken the mind
Incline to small doses as we approach this
Ever endless quest for a vengeance
While those who expose and pretend this
Life is just a big bowl of cherries
A bunch of fairies screaming to be scary

[Chorus]
It's propaganda
Sell it to the innocent
Oh yeah, they're buying it
Just tell them to rebel again

I'm a maniac, hard one to handle
You better come packing more than a scandal
Fucked over for the times I've been grateful
Fucked over led to times I've been hateful
Main attraction, fuck you in your pussy mouth
Cum again, friend, now we got some action
On and on is the name that they gave me
And your misery came here to save me

999,Johnny Cash,Sunday Morning Coming Down,sad,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head, that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and the songs I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playin' with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's fryin' chicken
And it took me back to somethin'
That I'd lost somewhere, somehow along the way

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleepin' city sidewalk
And Sunday mornin' comin' down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughin' little girl that he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singin'
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed thru the canyon
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound

'Cause he almost made off with a bunch of the drugs

And I wish I would've had the nerve to ask you to stay

You are the roots that sleep beneath my feet
And hold the earth in place
Each time a faucet opens, words are spoken
The water runs away
And I hear your name
No, nothing has changed

There was this book I read and loved
The story of a ship
Who sailed around the world and found
That nothing else exists

Beyond his own two sails and wooden shell
And what is held within
All else is sure to pass, we clutch and grasp
And debate what's truly permanent
But when the wind starts to shift
Well, there's no argument

Now, I sing and drink and sleep on floors
And try hard not to be annoyed
By all these people worrying about me
So when I'm suffering through some awful drive
You occasionally cross my mind
It's my hidden hope that you are still among them
Well are you?
Oh, you are the roots that sleep beneath my feet
And hold the earth in place

A lifetime melts away

And it blows my mind
Trying to deny it
But the damage is done
I'll just run as always
But the race is run

You've got to tell me it's over now
I'm trapped inside of a dream
The crushing weight on my shoulders now
Is bearing down and it seems
There's just no easy way out
No easy way out

Read the daily fiction
Superman is dead
Crushing coins of silver
Imitating lead
Then if you will fix the
Children of the past
I guess their's isn't welcome
Doesn't time move fast

You've got to tell me it's over now
I'm trapped inside of a dream
The crushing weight on my shoulders now
Is bearing down and it seems
There's just no easy way out
No easy way out

[Verse 3]
Night in the shadow of man
This is the dawn of the dead
Don't let it live in your head
And then now as the sabbath begins
It wakes your nightmare again
So run away if you can
So just run
Run as fast as you can

[Solo]

[Chorus]
You've got to tell me it's over now
I'm trapped inside of a dream
The crushing weight on my shoulders now
Is bearing down and it seems
There's just no easy way out
Too late too tell me it's over now
Falling apart at the seams
No angel sits on my shoulders now
I hold my head and it screams
There's just no easy way out
No easy way outEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock
1019,Richard Ashcroft,On A Beach,relaxed,"Ahh, I have swum those raging seas
Washed up by an ocean who had tired of me
How I survived I will never know
This wreck's got a home and a whole lot of hope

I'm out on a beach, sat on a rock
Thinking of you and the love I got
Saw the devil's servant, sent her home
Said bring me your master, I don't want his dog
I'm on fire, I'm full of love and new desire
I'm on fire, I'm full of love and new desire
Full of love and new desire

I lit my fire blew my conch, nobody comes
I built my boat from bamboo but it sunk
I looked at the sky for vapor trails nobody comes
I wrote your name on a tree along with the days
This is taking you away from me

I'm out on a beach, eating my heart
Thinking of you and the love I got
Saw the devil's servant, sent her home
Said bring me your master, I don't want his dog
I'm on fire, I'm full of love and new desire
I'm on fire (I need somebody like you), I ain't afraid to die
I ain't afraid to die, I ain't afraid to die

Don't want no Cap'n Crunch, don't want no Raisin Bran
Well don't you know that other kids are starvin' in Japan
So eat it, just eat it
Don't want to argue, I don't want to debate

Your table manners are a crying shame
You're playing with your food, this ain't some kind of game
Now, if you starve to death you'll just have yourself to blame

You haven't even touched your tuna casserole
You better chow down, or it's gonna get cold

And it just doesn't work out the way I want it to
And I get real frustrated
And like, I try hard to do it
And I like, take my time, but it just doesn't work out the way I want it to
It's like I concentrate on it real hard
But it just doesn't work out
And everything I do and everything I try
It never turns out
It's like, I need time to figure these things out
But there's always someone there going
""Hey Mike, you know, we've been noticing you've been having a lot of problems lately, you know?
You should maybe get away
And like, maybe you should talk about it, you'll feel a lot better""
And I go, ""No it's okay, you know, I'll figure it out
Just leave me alone, I'll figure it out, you know?
I'm just working on myself""
They go, ""Well you know, if you want to talk about it, I'll be here, you know
And you'll probably feel a lot better if you talk about it
So why don't you talk about it?""
I go, ""No I don't want to, I'm okay! I'll figure it out myself!""

To protect from the enemy, myself

I was in my room
And I was just like, staring at the walls thinking about everything
But then again, I was thinking about nothing
And then my mom came in, and I didn't even know she was there
She called my name and I didn't hear her
And then she started screaming, ""Mike! Mike!""
And I go, ""What? What's the matter?""
She goes, ""What's the matter with you?""
I go, ""There's nothing wrong mom""
She goes, ""Don't tell me that, you're on drugs!""
I go, ""No mom, I'm not on drugs, I'm okay, I'm just thinking, you know? Why don't you get me a pepsi?""

All I wanted was a Pepsi
Just one Pepsi
And she wouldn't give it to me

And I go, ""Okay, what's the matter?""
They go, ""Me and your mom, we've been noticing lately you've been having a lot of problems
And you've been going off for no reason
And we're afraid you're gonna hurt somebody
And we're afraid you're gonna hurt yourself,
So we decided that it would be in your best interest if we put you somewhere you could get the help that you need""
And I go, ""Wait! What are you talking about?
We decided?! My best interest?!
How do you know what my best interest is?
How can you say what my best interest is?

I went to your churches
I went to your institutional learning facilities!

1024,Cradle of Filth,Tonight in Flames,angry,"I will give to drink without cost from the springs of the water of life
He who overcomes will inherit all this
And I will be his God and he will be my son

When contrary winds blow across the sands
Their murmurs can be easily swayed
But when storms quicken one cannot placate
The howling of their murderous rages

Winged seraphim hold love's trembling hand
Beside our waiting graves
As war roars about out precious land
Seeking cause to subjugate

Tonight in flames
Tonight the world will fear our names
Tonight in flames
Stay my feeble heart
Our deaths will be the start
Of something glorious and vain
Tonight in flames

There is no fanaticism as virile as faith
To the blind his words are clear
Suffer not the infidel! Suffer not the infidel!
Assure your place in paradise here
Winged seraphim hold love's trembling hand
Beside her tiny grave
I will avenge her, do or damned
Her sacred mother did the same

I went to see her dance one day
In a play by a wailing wall
Now she is gone
But the song lives on
Zealous and maniacal

The Eastern sword must fall

Tonight in flames
Tonight the world will fear our names
Tonight in flames
Stay my feeble heart
Our deaths will be the start
Of something glorious and vain

Screaming to everything lying ahead

1027,DIR EN GREY,VINUSHKA,angry,"I exchange thoughts with the clouds
I hold my breath
Ahh, it's just hard shell you can't see
Is that where the bottom is? The shadow burns me
Ahh, I just want to keep forgetting
Slip your desires into the ants' nest
Come now, all you have to do now is be reborn again

Let tomorrow sleep and peacefulness will turn to you
Free yourself and go with your razor sharp emotions
Even the twisted flow is the proof that you are alive
I invite the tearfully-indulging tomorrow

The inculcated Dogra Magra
The pain of the mark and the one and only personality
And those colorful eyes all decorated I don't want them anymore
Is hypocrisy going to come and take it away?
The lonely red stage at night
I dedicate the following to the aspiring leading actor
That's where the truth is

The small corner of my un-cheatable heart says ""I still want to be here""
Who can't we forgive?
I let them hear my cold voice
And i swear

I will live with my work I scream with this body of flesh that separates heaven and hell
I carve the sins What will be the proof of my existence if it disappears with the wind?

""I've stared at the strong shining moon long enough to be bored
Can't even turn myself into a werewolf
But just enough to become crazy by the darkness
I want to suck the neck
The emptiness of the remains
I won't let you sleep
At the age where you just want attention...tonight I might go crazy for you.""

Everyone wants to reach out their hand and grab happiness
But they just end up becoming the monster that lies deep in darkness
The end has already come to life
It will take form at zero and will crawl back into the uterus and rot
Every time this happens your faces crumble

No one wants to talk about truth that hurts the ear
The suppressed minds

Compensate the sins and let life be gone

The emptiness of the antithesis
Becomes the choking and crying land
Bury the bones in the common land immersed in thesis
Be burdened by depression
The gritty tsunami takes me away and I smile with bitter tears
Couldn't understand the value of things
The hanging of the necks at the 13 stairs
Seeing people becoming friendly while clapping hands
That mixes in with sissy thoughts and hurts others
Seeing you like this it's just too sad

Splash of blood
Squashing basic instincts
Talk about death

I will live with my work I scream with this body of flesh that separates heaven and hell
I carve the sins. What will be the proof of my existence if it disappears with the wind?

No one wants to talk about the truth that hurts the ear
The suppressed minds

Compensate the sins, and let life be gone

Is it a sin for me to live because I am evil?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",metal
1028,Gary Numan,In A Dark Place,sad,"Something calls me
From a dark place

And so I pray every night

Something knows me
It whispers my name
And I'm losing my faith

I can feel it breathing
But it feels like something dead and cold

I can feel it waiting
But it waits for something in my soul

Sometimes I call out for you, and sometimes I'm afraid

So I beg God
For salvation, for an angel
Every night

And I ask God
Can He forgive me?
And I want to believe

I think I hear it laughing
But it sounds like my voice lost and old
I think it showed me Heaven
And now I know why I'm scared to die

Am I a fool in the dark, I don't know
Am I the ghost in my dreams, I don't know
Am I a shadow of life, I don't know
Am I afraid of the truth, I don't know

Sometimes I call out for you, and sometimes I'm afraid

So I ask for
One small mercy?
But it whispers 'Who are you?'

So I ask God
If He can save me?
He says 'It's all too dark'EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",pop

Niggas said Hova was over, such dummies
Even if I fell I'll land on a bunch of money
Y'all ain't got nothing for me

[Break: Jay-Z]
Nas, let that bitch breathe!
[Verse 3: Nas]
Success, McLaren, women staring
My villain appearance
Sacred blood of a king and my vein ain't spilling
Ghetto Othello, Sugar Hill Romello
Camaro driven, I climax from paper
Then ask: ""Why is life worth living?""
Is it to hunt for the shit that you want?
To receive's great, but I lust giving
The best jewelers wanna make my things
I make Jacob shit on Lorraine just to make me a chain
Niggas mentioned on One Love
Came home to the paper in hand
Ain't gotta brag about the Feds, young man
Old cribs I sold, y'all drive by like monuments
Google Earth Nas; I got flats in other continents
Worst enemies wanna be my best friends
Best friends wanna be enemies like that's what's in
But I don't give a fuck, walk inside the lion's den
Take everybody's chips, 'bout to cash them in
Up your catalog, dog, mine's worth too much
Like Mike Jacks ATV pub, Mottola can't touch
Let this bitch breathe! (Ha heh)

If you feel like singing a song
And you want other people to sing along
Just sing what you feel
Don't let anyone say it's wrong
And if you're trying to paint a picture
But you're not sure which colors belong
Just paint what you see
Don't let anyone say it's wrong

[Bridge]
And if you're strung out like a kite
Or stung awake in the night
It's alright to be frightened

[Chorus]
When there's a light (what light)
There's a light (one light)
There's a light (white light)
Inside of you

[Verse 2]
If you think you might need somebody
To pick you up when you drag
Don't lose sight of yourself
Don't let anyone change your bag
And if the whole world's singing your songs
And all of your paintings have been hung
Just remember what was yours is everyone's from now on

And that's not wrong or right
But you can struggle with it all you like
You'll only get uptight

Claiming prosperity in a downward spiral plan

For what we are being forced into

Is it our duty to die for governments and for gods?
Is it our privilege to slave for market and for industry?
Is it our right to follow laws, set to scare and to oppress?
Is it a gift to stay in line and will it take away the blame?

Your fishes, at me

1054,Rage Against the Machine,Settle for Nothing,angry,"[Verse]
A jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
Hatred passed on, passed on, and passed on
A world of violent rage but it's one that I can recognize
Having never seen the color of my father's eyes
Yes, I dwell in hell, but it's a hell that I can grip
I tried to grip my family but I slipped
To escape from the pain in an existence mundane
I got a nine, a sign, a set, and now I got a name

[Chorus]
Read my writing on the wall
No one's here to catch me when I fall
Death is on my side
Suicide

A jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home

I tried to grip my family but I slipped
To escape from the pain in an existence mundane

Read my writing on the wall

Caught between my culture and the system

Again we stalk the stage
At mach speed we engage
Feeding people's rage
The big cat's left its cage
Back in the bus again
To catch another plane
This behaviour's quite insane
But we do it for the fame

I lost my mind, I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
I lost my mind, I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road

The road will never end
It always starts again
Another show's around the bend
Another long-lost friend, oh
Faceless as the snow
There's nothing special about the road
It's just another haul
It's just too damn long, that's all

I lost my mind, I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
I lost my mind, I lost all my money

1056,The Helio Sequence,Back To This,relaxed,"We were giving up time
We were giving on back on all that's left to do
Sometimes you'll have to do
Sometimes there's nothing left to say

We were giving up time
We were giving up ties and everyone knew it too
Rope busted and disgusted
And all we knew we cared

But it always, comes back to this
Yes it always, comes back to this again

We were kicking around
We were broken up bound and everything fell to fear
Sometimes you can relate
Sometimes there's nothing left to say

We were giving up time
We were giving up ties and everyone knew it too
Tongue tied and divided
The wounds just couldn't be found

It always, comes back to this
Yes it always
Six feet below, a world flooded free
How should i know, so far from me
(i) could try for more, i could settle up for less
I'm not keeping score, (i) don't expect you to confess
One side is made, the other side too soon
I flip a coin, there's more sides than two
Trouble ahead, but there's just no going back
I pray for rain, while the water's rising fast

1057,The Fall,War,angry,"Tell of the birth
Tell how war appeared on earth

Musicians with gongs
Permeate the autobahns
Foetus of disgusting breath

And she split the egg
Cast a spell and war was born

Come follow me
Out of the obscurity
Pilgrims in songs
Swamp the empty aerodrome
Kalashnikovs but no houses
Women at the double, march
No food for the spouses
They wait for the US drop
Russians sit back and laugh

While war casts her gory locks
Over the deserted docks
She casts her gory locks
Over the deserted docks

She cast a spell
Split an egg and war was born
And pillage hopes with gusto
Even though they have no nerve
And she does just look on
And war does what she has to
War does what she has to
People get what they deserveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",hip hop

So you say I can be afraid
But I know I would have strayed
I sit and miss you so, a batch of alcohol ceases to control

Don't say you'll think about me
Or say that you can live without me
Didn't we make it nearly
For everything that I hold dearly
How many ways can I say plainly, we can
Before it wore on us thinly
To each and every degree
You've got me in agony

So you say I should call sometime Adam
But I know that'll make you cry
I'll say I hate you so, that you burned me so

In his octopus's garden in the shade
I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus's garden with me

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide-a-way beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found

I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

The coral that lies beneath the waves (Lies beneath the ocean waves)

No one there to tell us what to do

That pulls me down and turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
Then, I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So, desperately, I try to link it with my head
But instead, I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love

Whenever I'm standing my own ground?
You build me up and leave me there

From the day we met
You made me forget
All my fears
Knew just what to say
And you kissed away
All my tears
I knew this time I had finally found
Someone to build my life around
Be a lover and a friend
After all my heart had put me through
I knew that it was safe with you
And what we had would never end
Wrong again
Everybody swore
They'd seen this before
We'd be fine
And you'd come to see that you still loved me
In good time
And they said there's nothing you can do
It's something that he's going through
It happens to a lot of men
And I told myself that they were right
That you'd wake up and see the light
And I just had to wait 'til then
Wrong again
And it seemed to me the pain would last
My chance for happiness had passed
And nothing waited 'round the bend
I was sure I'd never find someone
To heal the damage you had done
My poor heart would never mend
Wrong again

I'm death's own little star
Can you trace the sins that haunt you
And play the Devil's cards as I do

I'm blessed, yet damned
I'm fallen, yet resurrected
I am all of nothing

I play death, you play alive
Triple sixes to rise
Can you see the visions I brought you
And the devilish games that I taught you

I am all that you see

What are we gonna do
Take a picnic to the park
Sing songs about the moon
I will bring the frisbee
I will bring the dog
We'll frolic in the pesticided grass beneath the smog
Don't gotta worry 'bout bee stings
Don't gotta worry 'bout ants
Now's the time to take off our shoes
And dance that cartoon dance
In the afternoon time
We will stroll downtown
Past messengers on bicycles
And men dressed up in gowns
If we should get tired, let's just take the bus
I hope that it's not crowded so we can sit up front
I can't even see them scrape the sky
Blurring the fashions whizzing by
Sun gets down in the evening
Lights start flashing on
The city swells with energy
The nightlife has begun
Kustle and bustle
So many sites to see
Endless excitement
Keeps me up 'till three
Don't wanna go to the movies
Who wants to sit inside
I didn't get on the guest list
Don't want to wait in line
Let's go eat pierogis at my favorite cafe
The waitress are grumpy and
Their English ain't so great
We'll talk ourselves in circles
Til the pancakes are all gone
Today's become tomorrow
I can see the pink of dawn
Oh, I'm getting tired, I'm oh so tired
I think it's time to retire
Time for bed
To rest my sleepy headEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",folk/acoustic

And if I were gay
We would swim in romance
But I'm not gay
So get your hand out of my pants

It's not that I dont care - I do
I just don't see myself in you
Another time, another scene
I'd be right behind you, if you know what I mean

'Cause if I were gay
I would give you my soul
And if I were gay
I would give you my whole being
And if I were gay
We would tear down the walls

1082,Bright Eyes,A Perfect Sonnet,sad,"[Verse 1]
Lately I've been wishing I had one desire
Something that would make me never want another
Something that would make it so that nothing mattered
All would be clear then
But I guess I'll have to settle for a few brief moments
And watch it all dissolve into a single second
And try to write it down into a perfect sonnet
Or one foolish line

Cause that's all that you'll get so you'll have to accept
You are here then you're gone
But I believe that lovers should be tied together
Thrown into the ocean in the worst of weather
And left there to drown
Left there to drown in their innocence
But as for me I'm coming to the final chapter
I read all of the pages and there is still no answer
Only all that was before I know must soon come after
That is the only way it can be

[Bridge]
So I stand in the sun
And I breathe with my lungs
I'm trying to spare me the weight of the truth
[Verse 2]
Saying everything you've ever seen was just a mirror
Spent your whole life sweating in an endless fever
And now you're laying in a bathtub full of freezing water
Wishing you were a ghost
But once you knew a girl and you named her Lover
Danced with her in kitchens through the greenest summer
Autumn came, she disappeared
You can't remember where she said she was going to
But you know that she's gone cause she left you a song
That you don't want to sing
Singing I believe that lovers should be chained together
Thrown into a fire with their songs and letters
And left there to burn
Left there to burn in their arrogance
But as for me I'm coming to my final failure
Killed myself with changes trying to make things better
Ended up becoming something other than what I had planned to be
Now I believe that lovers should be draped in flowers
And laid entwined together on a bed of clover
And left there to sleep
Left there to dream of their happiness5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget
One little heartache left as a token
One little plaything carelessly broken

Remember?

Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you
Remember?

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot

You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot
To remember

I can make a living off a magazine
I can design an engine sixty-four miles to a gallon of gasoline
I can make new antibiotics
I can make computers survive aquatic conditions
I know how to run a business
And I can make you wanna buy a product
Movers, shakers, and producers
Me and my friends understand the future
I see the strings that control the systems
I can do anything with no resistance 'cause—

[Chorus 2]
I can lead a nation with a microphone
With a microphone, with a microphone
And I can split the atom of a molecule
Of a molecule, of a molecule

[Trumpet Solo]​

[Verse 3]
Look at me, look at me, driving and I won't stop
And it feels so good to be alive and on top
My reach is global, my tower secure
My cause is noble, my power is pure
I can hand out a million vaccinations
Or let 'em all die in exasperation
Have 'em all healed from their lacerations
Or have 'em all killed by assassination
I can make anybody go to prison
Just because I don't like 'em
And I can do anything with no permission
I have it all under my command because—
[Chorus 3]
I can guide a missile by satellite
By satellite, by satellite
And I can hit a target through a telescope
Through a telescope, through a telescope
And I can end the planet in a holocaust (Ah!)
In a holocaust (Ah!)
In a holocaust (Ah!)
In a holocaust (Ah!)
In a holocaust (Ah!)
In a holocaust (Ah!)
(Ah!)

Ariel, listen to me
The human world, it's a mess
Life under the sea is better than anything they've got up there

The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake
Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for?

Under the sea

Darling, it's better
Down where it's wetter
Take it from me

Out in the sun they slave away
While we devotin'

1095,Lard,The Power of Lard,angry,"[Intro]
Lard, you can see it in the clouds up in the sky
Lard floats by in clusters in our water supply
Lard, it's all of us, man, in our pores and in our hair
Lard's what we conceal in those corny clothes we wear
Lard is all
Lard is divine
Lard is in control
Lard whips and chains our soul
We carry credit cards
We live in fear of art
Lard is the om
Lard is revolution
Lard is the tapeworm in the bottle of cheap tequila
That comes alive at night and sneaks up and bites your nipple
Lard

[Verse 1]
Nowadays, most of us need someone to run our personal life
Someone to see that the plants are watered
Someone to make sure the place is clean
Someone to make sure dinner is waiting
Someone to call for theater tickets
Someone to make up those cheap excuses
What we need is lard
Lard
[Interlude]
The answer
The dancer
The ointment
The dream
Absorb it
Inflame it
Respect it
Molest it
Lard

[Verse 2]
The country right now, it wants to be soothed
And told it doesn't have to pay or sacrifice or learn
No one is over the hill when the mountain comes to Muhammad

Mold over mind, hooray!

[Chorus]
The power of lard
The power of lard
The power of lard

Every time I take a crap, it's a cosmic experience
Religion and chemicals are the key to the future
Next time we have sex, just pretend that I'm Ed Meese
The weasels have it down, man, it's a whole new age

[Interlude]
Which would you prefer, a computer or a gun?
The sharks outlived the dinosaurs, you know

[Chorus]
The power of lard
The power of lard
The power of lard
The power of lard

[Verse 4]
Pity the poor trainer in the stable when the racehorse farts
Poison oak really is the aphrodisiac of the gods
When people are asleep, we must all become alarm clocks
Hey, man, life is my college

[Interlude]
It's dental floss of the mind
Who will babysit the babysitters?
[Verse 5]
Ever hear about the guy in New York whose dick
Fell off in the bath after he shot it full of coke?
It's okay to run out of butter in Zambia
Just smear squashed caterpillars on your toast
Waiter, there's a terrorist in my soup
Which came first, Max Headroom or Gerald Ford?
Are you a man or are you a mouse?
If you love your fun, die for it!

But I'm a little glowing friend
But really I'm not actually your friend

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

[Verse 1]
I have a secret to tell
From my electrical well
It's a simple message and I'm
Leaving out the whistles and bells
So the room must listen to me
Filibuster vigilantly
My name is blue canary
One note spelled l-i-t-e
My story's infinite
Like the Longines Symphonette
It doesn't rest

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet

I'm your only friend
I'm not your only friend
But I'm a little glowing friend
But really I'm not actually your friend
But I am

[Verse 2]
There's a picture opposite me
Of my primitive ancestry
Which stood on rocky shores
And kept the beaches shipwreck-free
Though I respect that a lot
I'd be fired if that were my job
After killing Jason off
And countless screaming Argonauts
Blue bird of friendliness
Like guardian angels it's
Always near
[Chorus 2]
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
While you're at it
Keep the nightlight on inside
The birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
While you're at it
Keep the nightlight on inside
The birdhouse in your soul
(Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul)
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
While you're at it
Keep the nightlight on inside
The birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet

1106,Pat Monahan,Her Eyes,happy,"She's not afraid; she just likes to use her night light
When she gets paid, true religion gets it all
If they fit right

She's a little bit manic, completely organic
Doesn't panic for the most part

She's old enough to know, and young enough not to say no
To any chance that she gets for home plate tickets to see the Mets
Like everybody, she's in over her head
Dreads Feds, Grateful Dead, and doesn't take meds

She's a Gemini Capricorn
Thinks all men are addicted to porn
I don't agree with her half the time
But, damn I'm glad she's mine

Her eyes, that's where hope lies
That's where blue skies
Meet the sunrise
Her eyes, that's where I go
When I go home

She got the kinda strength that every man wishes he had
She loved Michael Jackson up until he made Bad
Tells me that she lives about a hundred lives
Scares me to death when she thinks and drives
Says cowboy hats make her look fat
And I'm so glad she's mine

Her eyes, that's where hope lies
That's where blue skies
Meet the sunrise
Her eyes, that's where I go
When I go home

She doesn't know the word 'impossible'
Don't care where I've been and doesn't care where we're goin' to
She takes me as I am, and that ain't easy
She's beautiful. So beautiful

And sometimes I think she's truly crazy
And I love it

Her eyes, that's where hope lies
That's where blue skies
Always meet the sunrise
Her eyes, that's where I go
When I go home

Her eyes, that's where hope lies
That's where blue skies
Always meet the sunrise
Her eyes, that's where I go
When I go home

Trusts that you trust me

Wer auch immer dich durch die Nacht bringt, bitte glaub ihm nicht

Es ist so oh, ohne dich! Es ist so widerlich ich will das nicht!
Denkst Du vielleicht auch mal an mich?
Es ist so oh, ohne dich!
Und wenn Du einsam bist denkst Du vielleicht auch mal an mich
Ich nhte mir ein Bettbezug aus der Zeit die wir hatten und trink mir alte

I don't want pity
Just a safe place to hide
Mama please, let me back inside

The carnival drums all mad in the air
Grim reapers and skeletons and a missionary bell
O where do we go now but nowhere
In a colonial hotel we fucked up the sun
And then we fucked it down again
Well the sun comes up and the sun goes down
Going round and round to nowhere

Now swipes at my face with the paw of a bear
I turn the other cheek and you lay into that

While the bones of our child crumble like chalk

Sits gnawing her knuckles in the chemical light
O where do we go now but nowhere
You come for me now with a cake that you've made
Ravaged avenger with a clip in your hair
Full of glass and bleach and my old razorblades
O where do we go now but nowhere
[Chorus]
O wake up, my love, my lover wake up
O wake up, my love, my lover wake up

[Verse 3]
If they'd give me my clothes back then I could go home
From this fresh, this clean, antiseptic air
Behind the locked gates an old donkey moans
O where do we go now but nowhere
Around the duck pond we grimly mope
Gloomily and mournfully we go rounds again
And one more doomed time and without much hope
Going round and around to nowhere
From the balcony we watched the carnival band
The crack of the drum a little child did scare
I can still feel his fingers pressed in my hand
O where do we go now but nowhere
If I could relive one day of my life
If I could relive just a single one
You on the balcony, my future wife
O who could have known, but no one

[Chorus]
O wake up, my love, my lover make up
O wake up, my love, my lover make up2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

1132,Arab Strap,New Birds,sad,"You just have to be sure you're doing the right thing. I mean it's very easy to forget - she was just sitting there in the pub with her new friends and her new life and her new hair, and it might have been five years but you'd know just to look at her

I wasn't even sure it was her at first; I was ready to walk away but she smiled and called me over and we said hello for a bit. When we went back to our tables we were trying not to look over at each other and told our friends to stop staring. I didn't see her for the rest of the night, but by closing time the beer's kicked in so I go up and speak to her and we end up going for a walk, and talking about our new homes, our new jobs, our new friends, and our new birds

She said she'd been going out with him now for about two and a half years, but they don't live together so he'd never find out. And you think about chasing her about school when you were wee and lying in your bed and listening to love songs and pretending they were about you. And the first time you asked her out she said no but one night you went to a wedding and when you came back to the pub she'd changed her mind and you went out. You remember the way she swung her arms when she held your hand but you can't remember how she kissed and now you've got the chance to find out

But you have to remember there's this other kiss and she's sittin' at home wondering where you are and what you're doing. And you worked hard on this kiss and you know it inside out; it's as much yours as it is hers, and it took a long time to get right, it took months of practice and months of embarrassment, but now you've got it perfected and you've been looking forward to that kiss all week
You can see her breath in the air between your faces, as you stand in the leaves and she just asks you straight out if you want to come and stay at her flat. But you make sure you get separate taxis and you go home and there might be a slight regret and maybe you'll wonder what you missed, but you have to remember the kiss that you worked so hard on. And you'll know you've done the right thing1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",folk/acoustic

Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet

You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

Stalks his prey in the night

Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street

And suckers be thinkin' that they can fake this

Could run a train on punk fools that think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead, I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
To recall the downfall and the businesses that burnt us all
See through the news and the views that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff, fuck Manifest Destiny

Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

In a world where everybody fucks everybody else over

You who are so far from me
Far from me
So far from me
Way across some cold neurotic sea
Far from me

I would talk to you of all matter of things
With a smile you would reply
Then the sun would leave your pretty face
And you'd retreat from the front of your eyes
I keep hearing that you're doing best
I hope your heart beats happy in your infant breast

You are so far from me
Far from me
Far from me

There is no knowledge but I know it
There's nothing to learn from that vacant voice
That sails to me across the line
From the ridiculous to the sublime
It's good to hear you're doing so well
But really can't you find somebody else that you can ring and tell

[Chorus]
Did you ever
Care for me?
Were you ever
There for me?
So far from me

You told me you'd stick by me
Through the thick and through the thin
Those were your very words
My fair-weather friend
You were my brave-hearted lover
At the first taste of trouble went running back to mother

Far from me
Suspended in your bleak and fishless sea

Long ago in days of yore
It all began with a god named Thor
There were Vikings and boats
And some plans for a furniture store
It's not a bodega, it's not a mall
And they sell things for apartments smaller than mine
As if there were apartments smaller than mine

[Chorus]
Ikea: Just some oak and some pine and a handful of Norsemen
Ikea: Selling furniture for college kids and divorced men
Everyone has a home
But if you don't have a home you can buy one there

[Verse 2]
So rent a car or take the bus
Lay your cash down and put your trust
In the land where the furniture folds to a much smaller size
Billy the bookcase says hello
And so does a table whose name is Ingo
And the chair is a ladder-back birch but his friends call him Karl

Ikea: Just some oak and some pine and a handful of Norsemen
Ikea: Selling furniture for college kids and divorced men

Ikea: Meatballs, tasty
Ikea: Allen wrenches
All of them for free
All of them for me

And a chair and a lamp
And a shelf and some candles for you

Till I saw the American dream come true
In New Jersey, they got a goddamned Swedish parade

1147,Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds,Hallelujah,sad,"[Verse 1]
On the first day of May I took to the road
I'd been staring out the window most of the morning
I'd watched the rain claw at the glass
And a vicious wind blew hard and fast
I should have taken it as a warning
As a warning
As a warning
As a warning
I'd given my nurse the weekend off
My meals were ill prepared
My typewriter had turned mute as a tomb
And my piano crouched in the corner of my room
With all its teeth bared
All its teeth bared
All its teeth bared
All its teeth bared

[Chorus]
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

[Verse 2]
I left my house without my coat
Something my nurse would not have allowed
And I took the small roads out of town
And I passed a cow and the cow was brown
And my pyjamas clung to me like a shroud
Like a shroud
Like a shroud
Like a shroud
There rose before me a little house
With all hope and dreams kept within
A woman's voice close to my ear
Said, ""Why don't you come in here?""
""You looked soaked to the skin""
Soaked to the skin
Soaked to the skin
Soaked to the skin
[Chorus]
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

[Verse 3]
I turned to the woman and the woman was young
I extended a hearty salutation
But I knew if my nurse had been here
She would never in a thousand years
Permit me to accept that invitation
Invitation
That invitation
That invitation
Now, you might think it wise to risk it all
Throw caution to the reckless wind
But with her hot cocoa and her medication
My nurse had been my one salvation
So I turned back home
I turned back home I turned back home
Singing my song

[Chorus]
Hallelujah
The tears are welling in my eyes again
Hallelujah
I need twenty big buckets to catch them in
Hallelujah
And twenty pretty girls to carry
Them down
Hallelujah
And twenty deep holes to bury them in
Hallelujah
The tears are welling in my eyes again
Hallelujah
I need twenty big buckets to catch them in
Hallelujah
And twenty pretty girls to carry them down
Hallelujah
And twenty deep holes to bury them in6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

I want it all to end; I want the world to end

Every night, the dream is the same
I sit here waiting for the world to end, but it never ends
And everything I used to be has spiraled into insanity
Every night, I sweat and bleed in her name

The dark wave comes, sanity slips away
She screams from the alcove, ""I am the dog!""

She was born in the year of the dog
She never would betray the world I never saw
Blinded eyes that never see, shattered into infinity
Every night, the dream is the same

The dark wave comes, sanity slips away
She screams from the alcove, ""I am the dog!""

Every night, the dream is the same
I suffer, wading through the endless waves of empty disdain
And everything I used to be has spiraled into insanity

1158,Ice-T,O.G. Original Gangster,angry,"[Verse 1]
Ten years ago I used to listen to rappers flow
Talkin' bout the way they rocked the mic at the disco
I liked how that shit was goin' down
Dreamt about ripping the mic with my own sound
So I tried to write rhymes something like them
My boys said, ""That ain't you, Ice! That shit sounds like them.""
So I sat back, thought up a new track
Didn't fantasize, kicked the pure facts
Motherfuckers got scared cause they was unprepared
Who would tell it how it really was? Who dared?
A motherfucker from the West Coast, L.A
South Central, fool, where the Crips and the Bloods play
When I wrote about parties, it didn't fit
""6 N' the Mornin,"" that was the real shit

[Hook]
O.G. Original Gangster

[Verse 2]
When I wrote about parties, someone always died
When I tried to write happy, yo, I knew I lied
'Cause, I lived a life of crime Why play ya blind?
A simple look and anyone with two cents would know I'm
A hardcore player from the streets
Rapping bout hardcore topics over hardcore drum beats
A little different than the average though
Jet you through the fast lane, drop ya on death row
Cause anybody who's been there knows that
Life ain't so lovely on the blood-soaked fast track
That invincible shit don't work
Throw ya in a joint, you'll be coming out feet first
So I blast the mic with my style
Sometimes I'm ill and other times buckwild
But the science is always there
I'd be a true sucker if I acted like I didn't care
I rap for brothers just like myself
Dazed by the game in a quest for extreme wealth
But I kick it to you hard and real
One wrong move, and your cap's peeled
I ain't no super hero, I ain't no Marvel comic
But when it comes to game I'm atomic
At dropping it straight, point blank and untwisted
No imagination needed, cause I lived it
This ain't no fucking joke, this shit is real to me
I'm Ice-T, O.G
[Hook}

[Verse 3]
Two weeks ago I was out at the disco
Two brothers stepped up to me and said, ""Hey yo, Ice
We don't think you're down. What set ya claiming?""
E drew the Glock, yo my set's aiming!
Dumb motherfucker, try to roll on me, please!
I'm protected by a thousand emcees
And hoodlums and hustlers and bangers with jheri curls
We won't even count the girls
Cause they got my back and I got theirs too
Fight for the streets when I'm on Oprah or Donahue
They try to sweat a nigga but they just didn't figure
That my wit's as quick as a hair trigger
""He's not your everyday-type prankster.""
I'm Ice-T, the original gangster

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
So step to me if you think that you're ready to
Got on your bullet proof? Well mine's going right thru
This ain't no game to me, it's hollow fame to me
Without respect from streets, so I don't claim be
The hardest motherfucker on earth
Catch me slipping, I can't even get worked
But I don't slip that often, there's a coffin
Waiting for the brother who comes off soft when
The real fucking shit goes down, take a look around
All them pussies can be found
They talk a mean fight but fight like hoes
I'm from South Central, fool, where everything goes
Snatch you out your car so fast you'll get whiplash
Numbers on your rooftop for when the copters pass
Gangbangers don't carry no switchblades
Every kid's got a Tec 9 or a hand grenade
Thirty-seven killed last week in a crack war
Hostages tied up and shot in the liquor store
Nobody gives a fuck
""The children have to go to school!"" Well, moms, good luck!
Cause the shit's fucked up bad I use my pad and pen
And my lyrics break out mad
I try to write about fun and the good times
But the pen yanks away and explodes and destroys the rhyme
Maybe it's just cause of where I'm from

He wears cor-blimey trousers

In his great big hobnail boots
He's got such a job to pull them up
That he calls 'em daisy roots

Some folks give tips at Christmas
And some of them forget
So when he picks their bins up
He spills some on the step

Next time my old man went 'round there
He punched him up the throat

He's got an 'eart of gold
He got married recently
Though he's eighty-six years old

We said ""'Ere, hang on, Dad
You're getting past your prime""
He said ""Well, when you get to my age
It helps to pass the time.""

Oi! My old man's a dustman
He wears a dustman's hat
He wears cor-blimey trousers
And he lives in a council flat
Lonnie: I say, I say, I say!
Les: Huh?
Lonnie: My dustbin's full of lilies
Les: Well throw 'em away then!
Lonnie: I can't: Lily's wearing them

Now one day whilst in a hurry
He missed a lady's bin
He hadn't gone but a few yards
When she chased after him

""What game do you think you're playing?""
She cried right from the 'eart
""You've missed me, am I too late?""
""No, jump up on the cart!""

Oi! My old man's a dustman
He wears a dustman's hat
He wears cor-blimey trousers
And he lives in a council flat

Lonnie: I say, I say, I say!
Les: Not you again!
Lonnie: My dustbin's absolutely full with toadstools
Les: How do you know it's full?
Lonnie: 'Cause there's not mushroom inside
He found a tiger's head one day
Nailed to a piece of wood
The tiger looked like miserable
But I suppose he should

Just then from out a window
A voice began to wail
It said ""Oi! Where's me tiger's head?""
""Four foot from his tail.""

Oh my old man's a dustman
He wears a dustman's hat
He wears cor-blimey trousers
And he lives in a council flat

Next time you see a dustman
Looking all pale and sad
Don't kick him in the dustbin
It might be my old dadEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",pop
1167,The Decemberists,The Hazards of Love 4 (The Drowned),sad,"Margaret arrayed the rocks around the hull before it was sinking
A million stones, a million bones, a million holes within the chinking

And painting rings around your eyes these peppered holes so filled with crying
A whisper weighed upon the tattered down where you and I were lying
Tell me now, tell me this, A forest's son, a river's daughter
A willow on the willow wisp, our ghosts will wander all of the water
So let's be married here today these rushing waves to bear our witness
And we will lie like river stones rolling only where it takes us
But I pulled you and I called you here
(Didn't I? Didn't I? Didn't I?)
And I caught you and I brought you here
(Didn't I? Didn't I? Didn't I?)
These hazards of love, never more will trouble us
Oh Margaret the lapping waves are licking quietly at our ankles
Another bow another breath this brilliant chill's come for the shackle
With this long last rush of air we speak our vows and starry whispers
When the waves came crashing down, he closed his eyes and softly kissed her

But I pulled you and I called you here
And I caught you and I brought you here
These hazards of love, never more will trouble us

Woman you want me, give me a sign
And catch my breathing even closer behind
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo

In touch with the ground
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Smell like I sound, I'm lost in a crowd
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Straddle the line, in discord and rhyme
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Mouth is alive, with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the wolf

Stalked in the forest, too close to hide
I'll be upon you by the moonlight side

You feel my heat, I'm just a moment behind
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo

I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Scent and a sound, I'm lost and I'm found

Step as lightly as a feather

Come

Loosen up and start to limber
Can't you hear that hot marimba?

Beneath the sacred mountain

And when it's time I'll go and wait
Beside a legendary fountain
'Til I see your form reflected
In its clear and jeweled waters
And if you think I'm ready
You may lead me to the chasm
Where the rivers of our vision
Flow into one another
I will want to dive beneath
The white cascading waters

She may argue with her logic
And mention all the things I'll lose
That really have no value

Are my eyes unlookable?

Am I unlovable?

Cynical, jaded, faithless, disappointed, disillusioned, used
If I could take back all my sweat, my tears, my sex, my joy I would
My time, my love, my effort, passion, dedication
In a case of mistaken identity I gave these things to you
I sound angry, bitter, sad, infatuated, it's the truth
Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, just a few
Stages of acceptance that it's really over
It's just so complicated, I'm stupid for believing in you

You make me feel like the act of love is empty
Am I so unlovable?
Is my skin untouchable?
Do I remind you of a part of you that you don't like?

I had your back, I held you up, I told you you were good enough
It was never reciprocated, you kept affection and then yourself apart
You fed your love to me like crumbs to pigeons in the park
Sometimes I think it satisfied you seeing me begging like a dog
I wasn't armoured, you were king, I gave my everything
Because sometimes you showed me just a hint of you within
For just a moment I romanticised the notion
I can take away the torment, I can love you like they never did

I heard a funny noise
Went out to the back yard to find out
If it was one of those rowdy boys
Stood there was my neighbour called Peter
And a flux capacitor

He told me he built a time machine
Like the one in a film I've seen

And your great, great, great granddaughter

And I saw everything

And another one

Totally naked!

Goodbye was half the words you knew

Is there even room for you to try

Goodbye was just what you do

This is the first day of my last days
I built it up, now I take it apart

And they take anything they choose

It's good to see you

Can't decide, then look at the faces

And we pretend (and always be)

When we have these mornings where we can't say goodbye

I wanted to mean everything to you

You keep coming back disassembled and I
Keep losing this fight

I won't answer...

Dancing under starlight glow
No one in the city knows
Confidence can take you
Nerves try to shake you
From going all the way

It's not that far...

It's good to see you
I missed you last night
That's such a lovely color
It goes with your eyes
Before we fall asleep
I just wanted to say
This all seems so easy
But there's choices to make
We watch the tide roll in
With cold air and coffeecakes
Holding our words at lips
Stopping the sounds they make
We know the way to go
We know each step to take
To be here

These words with no replies
Stopping we's, starting I's
This need is killing me
And taking me over

I wanted to mean everything to you

Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

[Verse 1]
Niggas wanna try, niggas wanna lie
Then niggas wonder why niggas wanna die
All I know is pain, all I feel is rain
How can I maintain with that shit on my brain?
I resort to violence, my niggas move in silence
Like you don't know what our style is, New York niggas the wildest
My niggas is with it, you want it? Come and get it
Took it then we split it, you fuckin' right we did it
What the fuck you gon' do when we run up on you?
Fuckin' with the wrong crew, don't know what we goin' through
I'ma have to show niggas how easily we blow niggas
Lemme find out there's some more niggas that's runnin' with your niggas
Nothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle
Light it up like a candle just 'cause I can't stand you
Put my shit on tapes like you bustin' grapes
Think you holdin' weight then you haven't met the apes
[Chorus]
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

Stop actin' like a baby, mind your business, lady
Nosy people get it too, when you see me spit at you
You know I'm tryin' to get rid of you, yeah I know, it's pitiful
That's how niggas get down, watch my niggas spit rounds
Make y'all niggas kiss ground just for talkin' shit, clown
Oh, you think it's funny? Then you don't know me, money
It's about to get ugly, fuck it, dawg, I'm hungry
I guess you know what that mean, come up off that green
Rob niggas on Ravine, don't make it a murder scene
Give a dog a bone, leave a dog alone
Let a dog roam and he'll find his way home
Home of the brave, my home is a cage
And, yo, I'm a slave 'til my home is the grave
I'ma pull capers, it's all about the papers
Bitches caught the vapors and now they wanna rape us

Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop

[Verse 3]
Look what you done started, asked for it, you got it
Had it, shoulda shot it, now you're dearly departed
Get at me, dawg, did I rip shit? With this one here I flip shit
Niggas know when I kick shit it's gon' be some slick shit
What was that look for when I walked in the door?
Oh, you thought you was raw? Boom, not anymore
'Cause now you on the floor wishin' you never saw
Me walk through that door with that four-four
Now it's time for bed, two more to the head
Got the floor red, yeah, that nigga's dead
Another unsolved mystery, it's goin' down in history
Niggas ain't never did shit to me, bitch-ass niggas can't get to me
Gots to make a move, got a point to prove
Gotta make 'em groove, got 'em all like, ""Ooh""

Plowing these fields in the hot summer sun
Over by the gate lordy here she comes
With a basket full of chicken and a big cold jug of sweet tea
I make a little room and she climbs on up
Open up a throttle and stir a little dust
Just look at her face she ain’t a fooling me

She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always staring at me
While I'm chugging along
She likes the way it's pulling while we're tilling up the land
She's even kind of crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy

We ride back and forth 'til we run out of light
Take it to the barn put it up for the night
Climb up in the loft sit and talk with the radio on
She said she's got a dream and I asked what it is
She wants a little farm and a yard full of kids
One more teeny weenie ride before take her home

Retained some of our teeth
And gained a choice

Until satisfied
And when its time to rest
Ask ""whats next?""

When our instincts are egging us on

To four letters
And when we think about it
We're like a masterpiece
Whose glimpsed the artist

We are the machines
Carrying our various genes
Then discarded
When the job is done
We are the disciples
Who have lost our way
Kicked from our pedestal when Darwin burnt the book

Whose glimpsed the artist

The stars revolve around the human race
But we're just mammals, just primates

Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
I'm sweeter and thicker than a Chick-O-Stick
Here's an ice cream cone honey take a lick
Or go to Bay Plaza and catch a flick
Wore my Timberland boots so I can stomp ticks
Scandalous get a whiff of this, miss
Just left the yard boys, now I'm blissed
I feel good per say good state of mind
Drive a red Sterling and the seats recline
I love it when a lady treats me kind
Go to Tavern on the Green and have a glass of wine
He say, she say, I heard it through the grapevine
No static, got an automatic
Too much of anything makes you an addict
Teasin, skeezin, all so pleasin
Don't ask why I got my own reasons

I was on 125 and Saint Nick
Waiting on a cab, standing in the rain
Under my heart three clouds of pain
She got the best of me
What was her destiny?
Maybe I should lick her with my nine millime...ter
My mind is in a blur
Cause you could never pay me to think this would occur
Me and this girl Jane Doe was living together
We were inseparable, noone could sever
At least that's what I thought
But later I fought with her substance
And almost ended up in Supreme Court
When I was on the road doing shows getting ends
She was in my Benz getting sniffy with her friends
And even when she crashed my whip I didn't flip
My man Slick Nick said Smooth you're starting to slip
Time went on I started noticing weight loss
Then I had to ask her was she riding the white horse
At first she said no, then she said yo Smooth I'm sorry
But I keep having visions of snow, I need blow
And I said whoa, little hottie
I'm not DeLorean, Gambino or Gotti
I don't deal coke, and furthermore you're making me broke
I'll put you in a rehab and I won't tell your folks
And what do you know
In 18 months she came home and I let her back in
And now she's sniffing again...

And I ain't out shopping spending dudes C-notes

Tonight Lil' Kim gon' have you in the zone
Girls, call ya crib, I'm answering the phone
Guys wanna wife me and give me the ring

And I'm standing right here in this place again
Hoping that you would forgive my sin…

So they won't just spill away
Just like the moonlight needs the sunrise
So the night can turn to day
Just like the flowers need the showers
So their beauty won't decay

That's how I want you
That's how I need your love... today

1239,Nappy Roots,Good Day,happy,"Let's begin now

[Intro: Fish Scales]
Know today, I woke up this morning, and I said
You know, instead of waitin' on a good day
Waitin' around, through ups and downs, waitin' on somethin' to happen
I just said...

[Chorus]
We're gonna have, we're gonna have, we're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You can save that drama for another day
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day

[Verse 1: Big V]
Hairline fresh, new cologne on
Feelin' so good, change the colors to my phone
Orange Kool-Aid go good with Patron
Oh no, hell no, boy is still my ring tone
Free car wash, had to clean up the Dodge
Give back when I can, just playin' my part
Church folks had a fish fry, mustard, hot sauce
Light bread and french fries, love for the big guy
Hit the park, boys showin' off their hops
Nappy Roots on the radio and you know it bop
Last night, hit the pick three, bought some Air Force Ones
Four tall tees, man I'm loving B.G.​
[Chorus: Children Choir]
We're gonna have, we're gonna have, we're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You can save that drama for another day
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day

[Verse 2: Fish Scales]
And I ain't finna worry 'bout what nobody say
I'm still above ground, and that's the reason I pray
Got my car cleaned up, now I'm ready to play
Make a call to the sticks, say I'm headed their way
Heard my cousin cookin' out, I gotta get me a plate
Got this new outfit, ain't even out in the States
So if I ain't speakin' too soon, but this a hell of a day
And this sticky got me sittin' in a hell of a place
Got my stunna shades on and grin on my face
My new grill looks mean but I swear I'm straight
And the hood showin' love so I'm A-ok
[Chorus: Children Choir]
We're gonna have, we're gonna have, we're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You can save that drama for another day
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day

[Verse 3: Skinny DeVille]
We might as well do exactly what the children sayin'
Take the day off, hit the park and just hang
Barbeque, roll a few, and put up your deuce
If it's beef, put down the peace down, throw up your dukes
It's time to change our ways so we can save the day
For the children's sake and make a better place to play
And if it's all good, break out your coop and grip your wood
And if you're ridin' dirty, light your spliff and blow your—
But do it real big, exactly like a player should
Enjoy your 24, do your thing and rep your hood
The world is all yours, but still we all grind
Forever and a day, the choice you make is really all fine
[Chorus: Children Choir]
We're gonna have, we're gonna have, we're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You can save that drama for another day
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You can save that drama for another day
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day

Life is prison, no parole, no control
The jura got my number on a wire tap
'Cause I jack for Similac, fuck a Cadillac
Survive, one motive, no hope
'Cause every sidewalk I walk is like a tightrope
Yes, I know my deadline, sire, when my life expires
I'm sendin' paper south under the barbed wire
The mother of my child will lose her mind at my grave
It's my life for their life, so call it a free trade
""Por vida"" and our name up on the stall
I took a death trip when I tried to cross the white wall

Pop's heart stopped, in came the air drop
Flooded the trench, he couldn't shake the toxic shock
Maize was all we needed to sustain
Now her golden skin burns, insecticide rain
Ya down wit' DDT, yeah, you know me
I'm raped for the grapes, profit for the bourgeoisie
War tape boomin', path is Luminoso
I'm headed north like my name was Kid Cisco
To survive, one motive, no hope, uh
It's hard to breathe with Wilson's hand around my throat, uh
Strangled and mangled, another SS curtain call
When I tried to cross the white walls
When I tried to cross the white walls

No crying He makes

Look down from the sky
And stay by my side

Weight off my shoulders
Unleashed

Leaving deadlands

No war, no more

It made our ways insane again

They blot out the sun
They fought this war like never before

Today I wake, the wall has fallen
They worship no more
And the temple is gone
Them eyes will bleed the tears of sin
All ears will hear, unleash within

Kept Dickens and Rembrandt and Beethoven
And fresh plowed sod

And a safe place
For kids to play
Shine on bombs exploding

1258,The Waterboys,Red Army Blues,sad,"When I left my home and my family
My mother said to me
""Son, it's not how many Germans you kill that counts
It's how many people you set free! ""

So I packed my bags
Brushed my cap
Walked out into the world
Seventeen years old
Never kissed a girl

Took the train to Voronezh
That was as far as it would go
Changed my sacks for a uniform
Bit my lip against the snow
I prayed for mother Russia
In the summer of '43
And as we drove the Germans back
I really believed
That God was listening to me

We howled into Berlin
Tore the smoking buildings down
Raised the red flag high
Burnt the reichstag brown
I saw my first American
And he looked a lot like me
He had the same kinda farmer's face
Said he'd come from some place called Hazzard, Tennessee
Then the war was over
My discharge papers came
Me and twenty hundred others
Went to Stettiner for the train
Kiev! Said the commissar
From there your own way home
But I never got to Kiev
We never came by home
Train went north to the Taiga
We were stripped and marched in file
Up the great siberian road
For miles and miles and miles and miles
Dressed in stripes and tatters
In a gulag left to die
All because Comrade Stalin was scared that
We'd become too westernized!

Used to love my country
Used to be so young
Used to believe that life was
The best song ever sung
I would have died for my country
In 1945
But now only one thing remains
But now only one thing remains
But now only one thing remains
But now only one thing remains

You sweetly, swiftly shift
Shaking the shakes I'm faking you're shaking
And you're quick to steal a kiss
So in a frozen motion I silently scream
You flinch but you won't back down
You dare me, you try to scare me
But you know I'll stand my ground

Fuck You, fuck you, fuck you and only you
Fuck you, fuck you, i will get over you

Inch by inch I'm closing in
Your eyes have sealed the dawn
Now it's only a matter of time before you shatter
Try to walk away with pieces that you want
So you seek secrets of my soul
My misery I hope you'll miss
Cast your hooks, I hope you catch
A glimpse of blinded bliss

Fuck you, fuck you, i will get over you

Who's gonna guess it, or believe
Everything's crossed my mind
So don't you blink, I'm trying to think
Well everything could unwind
Well you move me, you used to use me
Now it's time to stand this ground
And if I don't come back, nothing will collapse
Nothing really ever comes around
So surely I said sorry
If you believe half the things that we've done
You must've done them too
Cause you know I'm cut in two
Just above the balcony I'm hung from
Fuck youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

[Verse 1]
Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcerers of death's construction
In the fields, the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh, Lord, yeah

[Bridge]
Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that all to the poor, yeah
Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait till their judgment day comes, yeah
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Now, in darkness, world stops turning
Ashes where their bodies burning
No more war pigs have the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of Judgment, God is calling
On their knees, the war pigs crawling
Begging mercies for their sins
Satan, laughing, spreads his wings
Oh, Lord, yeah

We should have told you

Lurking in the core of us all
The last dying call for the ever lost
Brief encounters, bleeding pain

[Instrumental Interlude]

Lepers coiled neath the trees
Dying men in bewildered soliloquies
Perversions bloom around the bend
Seekers, lost in their quest
Ghosts of friends frolic under the waning moon

It is the year of death
Wielding his instruments
Stealth sovereign reaper
Touching us with ease

Infecting the roots in an instant
Burning crop of disease
I am just a spectator
An advocate documenting the loss
Fluttering with conceit
This doesn't concern me yet
Still far from the knell
Taunting their bereavement
Mob round the dead
Point fingers at the details
Probing vomits for more
Caught in unbridled suspense

We have all lost it now
Catching the flakes of dismay
Born the travesty of man
Regular pulse midst pandemonium
You're plucked to the mass
Parched with thirst for the wicked

Sick liaisons raised this monumental mark

There is a place
With a bit more time
And a few more
Gentler words
And looking back
We do forgive
(we had no choice
We always did)
All that we hope
Is that when we go
Our skin
And our blood
And our bones
Don't get in your way

He walks below the land
Alluring victims to their death
Perish to the sand
Master of the blackened arts
Living his decree
Thrives amongst the seven gates
Searching for the keys

I have seen the darkened depths of Hell
Sorcery beyond the witches' spell
Robbed the crypts of death's eternity
Killed the priest and cursed him endlessly

Chants of evil incantation
Fill the murky night
Free the Devil's knights of Hell
Unleash their growing spite
Directing power forcibly
The fire of Hell is cast
Resurrect from crypts of death
A demon from the past

Sorcery beyond the witches' spell
Robbed the crypts of death's eternity

Decay to powder, ashes to dust

Daydreamed of what we could have been
How many times I
Find myself asking why

Can you tell me what I gotta do?
'Cause I never wanna say goodbye
Don't wanna say goodbye again
Now I know that I was meant for you
One more time I can't bear to lose
I don't ever wanna say goodbye
Don't wanna say goodbye again

We thought it'd last forever, but I was swept away
What I thought I knew it wasn't true
I wish I would've knew before today
I always said I'd never let myself lose again
Yes, I found a way what I gotta do to get myself back to you

Inner city life, inner city pressure
The concrete world is starting to get ya
The city is alive, the city is expanding
Living in the city can be demanding
You've pawned everything, everything you own
A toothbrush jar and a camera-phone
You don't know where you're going
You cross the street
You don't know why you did
You walk back across the street
Standing in the sitting room, totally skint
And your favorite jersey is covered in lint
You want to sit down, but you sold your chair
So you just stand there

From a quarter past six 'til a quarter to seven
The manager, Bevin, starts to abuse me
""Hey man, I just want some muesli""
Neon signs, hidden messages
Questions, answers, fetishes
You know you're not in high finance
Considering secondhand underpants
Check your mind, how'd it get so bad?
What happened to those other underpants you had?
Look in your pockets, haven't found a cent yet
Landlord's on your balls, ""Have you paid your rent yet?""

And I stopped him on the street to ask him how it went, and all he did was cry
I looked him in the face, but I couldn't see past his eyes
Asked him what the problem was, he says ""Here is your disguise""

Now he's hardly getting over it
He's hardly getting used to getting by
Now he's hardly getting over it
He's hardly getting used to getting by

Old man lays down by the railroad tracks
Got no paper in his pocket, got no paper on his back
I asked him what the time was, he says ""To hit the road now, Jack""
Went back to see him next week, he died of a heart attack and died away

Now he's hardly getting over it
He's hardly getting used to getting by
Now he's hardly getting over it
He's hardly getting used to getting by

Grandma, she got sick, she is going to die
And Grandpa had a seizure, moved into a hotel cell and died away

And what do I do when they die?

I'm lost and alone
Though I said I'd go before us
And show the way back home
Is there a light up ahead?
I can't hold on very long
Forgive me, pretty baby
But I always take the long way home

Money's just something you throw
Off the back of a train

And a hat full of rain
And I know that I said
I'd never do it again
Oh and I love you, sweet baby
But I always take the long way home

I put food on the table
And a roof overhead
But I'd trade it all tomorrow
For the highway instead
Watch your back, if I should tell you
Love's the only thing I've ever known
One thing for sure, sweet baby
I always take the long way home
You know I love you, baby
More than the whole wide world
I'm your woman
You know you are my pearl
So let's go out past the party lights
Where we can finally be alone
Come with me
And we can take the long way home

Prepare to indent, a coma that read
Floating in a soundproof costume
Here comes the monolith
Brass knuckles for the hissie fit
An abbreviation for the landing of fleets

1313,Augie March,There Is No Such Place,relaxed,"There is no such place, o yes I have seen it too
Just a little different from how you do
A river winding blue among the dunes and a marble bed
A sun that doesn't set but settles
There is no such place
If I lower mine to yours would you kiss me on the face?
If you're looking for an unmarked place
There is no such place -
Blasted in appearance and a composite of fearful minutes
Frozen in the waking instant
Longing, things I long for
Peaceful nights, strangers at the door
O come in, come in
You've been here before
There is no such place, so perhaps we have a reason
For our long and falling face
Above all it would be warm but we would keep our heads all
Clear as Winter, storms would be a sight to make us shiver
But without the chill
Of thinking all is hither-thither -
Longing, Things I long for
Peaceful nights, strangers at the door
O come in, come through the door
You've been here before
You've been here before
There is no such place, o yes I have seen it too
Just a little different from how you do
A house upon a hill with no windows
Just a can upon the sill
To catch your tears
To feed your gardenEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

Your reign of terror is coming to an end
And all your victims' pain will be avenged
Taker of innocence, I want your demise
Tear you apart for the unspeakable things you tried to hide
I fucking hate you
Every bone in my body will ache
'Till I destroy everything you love
And fill your life with their pain

Ten long fucking years (long fucking years)
I waited to erase all the memories
And you can't fucking stop me
My vengeance is finally born
Ten long fucking years (long fucking years)
Your reign of terror is coming to an end
And I have no mercy for your soul
Your blood is on my hands

Cut it out
Your self-inflicted pain
Is getting too routine
The crowds are catching on
To the self-inflicted song
Well, here we go again
The art of acting weak
Fall in love to fail
To boost your CD sales
And that CD sells (Yeah, what a hit)
You've got to repeat it
You gotta sink to swim

[Chorus]
If at first you don't, you don't succeed
You gotta recreate your misery
'Cause we all know art is hard
Young artists have gotta starve
Try, and fail, and try again
The comforts of repetition
Keep churning out those hits
Till it's all the same old shit

[Verse 2]
Oh, a second verse!
Well, color me fatigued
I'm hiding in the leaves
In the CD jacket sleeves
Tired of entertaining
Some double-dipped meaning
A soft serve analogy
This drunken angry slur
In thirty-one flavors
[Bridge]
You gotta' sink, gotta sink
Gotta sink to swim
Immerse yourself in rejection
Regurgitate some sorry tale
About a boy who sells his love affairs
You gotta' fake, fake, fake the pain
You better make, make, make it sting
You're gonna' break, break, break a leg
When you get on stage
And they scream your name
""Oh, Cursive is so cool!""

[Outro]
(""Oh, Cursive is so cool!"")
You gotta' sink, gotta sink
Gotta sink to swim
Impersonate greater persons
'Cause we all know art is hard
When we don't know who we are

1317,The String Cheese Incident,Sometimes a River,relaxed,"I was cleaning the ash from the fire
And putting the party away
Helping out all of my lost friends
To see the light of day

I'm feeling the wind through the window
Sometimes you crash through the wall
Seems like it comes out of nowhere
There's no warning at all

Sometimes a river, sometimes a river runs high
Sometimes a river, sometimes a river runs dry

I was making my way through a movie
And finding it hard to decide
Sometimes it comes without warning
It turns me over inside

I'm making a stab in the darkness
But you're wearing a hole in the floor
Suddenly everything changes
You're not the same as before

Sometimes a river, sometimes a river runs high
Sometimes a river, sometimes a river runs dry
You danced in my dream in a white dress
I watched from the top of the stairs
I woke up looking to find you
But you were not there

Seventeen hours of driving
But that's not a surprise
The world's all heavy with traffic
We never were good at goodbyes

No we never were no good at goodbyesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",country

The world can disappear

Only you
Make my heart heal

Going round in a million ways
And never understand

'Cause our words are whispers
Hidden up in a distant haze
Like diamonds next to sand

And I don't even know
Just what it's all about
But I get all blissed out
And then I know
It's only youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",pop

Your lips glistening in the light

Walking back towards your house
Rain drops bouncing off the leaves
Down to our September kiss

Flying over bus stops and playgrounds
I'm here soaked right to the core
I'll stay here forever
I'm safe with you

If all the words I ever wrote
On the back of envelopes
I could fold into paper planes
I could fly them through your veins
Helicopters overhead
Wide awake at 3am
Now the ink runs to your heart
And you know just how I feel

Flying over bus stops and playgrounds
I'm here soaked right to the core
I'll stay here forever
I'm safe with you
Flying over bus stops and playgrounds
I'm here soaked right to the core

If one day you'd backed up
A promise you made
We'd have to make it a holiday
'Cause we both know
That day would never come again
If one day your word
Was as good as gold
It'd be too late 'cause I'd be too old
I don't think a human being
Could live that long

[Pre-Chorus]
I never gave a damn
I was never even a fan
The only thing that
Makes me smile is your pain
I don't even care
When did you treat anyone fair?
To say I'm not enjoying this
Would be insane

[Chorus]
Sodium pentathol was an idea I had
But what does the truth mean now
To all the  lost souls you've grabbed?
A mass delusion, mass delusion
There's no confusion, no confusion
Just a hypocrite who'd never cop to it
[Post-Chorus]
You're in total control
And you're still a liar
I can't drink from the cup
I question your authority
You gotta 'fess up
You're in total control
And your faith is tired
I can't drink from the cup
Where is truth in the trinity?
You gotta 'fess up

If this affects it, it's hard to tell
You spend too many
Cold days in your cell
Never been one to admit that
Something might be wrong

The only thing that
Makes me smile is your pain
If I ever had the chance
I'd kick out your chair
Just to watch you dance
Irrelevant, your vanity prevents change

Sodium pentathol
Still sounds great to me
An imitation of life buried in theology
A mass delusion, mass delusion
There's no confusion, no confusion
Just a hypocrite who'd never cop to it

And you're still a liar
I can't drink from the cup

I can't drink from the cup
Where is truth in the trinity?
You gotta 'fess up

I flee...
Throughout the years of throe
Watching through a mirror, as I fall apart
I see a wreck, I'm burning

I see angels burning, falling down in ruins
Looking down I see me, I'm my own enemy

Watching myself decaying, (decaying)
Falling from high spirits
I flee...
Throughout the ruins of me
Longing for finding my way out
Leaving myself, there's nothing left for me
The ruins are about to crumble down

The flame is dying by shivery winds of jet black skies
It reflects hatred in my eyes

I see angels burning, falling down in ruins
Looking down, I see my ashes scattered around my grave

Angels whispering fire, no longer I'm alive
Settled down, I'm done with the trip to my kingdom come1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",metal
1324,N.W.A,Fuck tha Police,angry,"[Produced by Dr. Dre & DJ Yella]
[Intro: The D.O.C., Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube]
Right about now, N.W.A court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A versus the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube
And Eazy-motherfucking-E
Order, order, order!
Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth so help your black ass?
You goddamn right
Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown
And not the other color, so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beating on and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me 'cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just 'cause I'm from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me, huh
A young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops dying in L.A. 
Yo, Dre, I got something to say
[Chorus]
Fuck the police, fuck— fuck—
Fuck the police, fuck— fuck—
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police (Example of scene one)

[Skit 1: Cop, MC Ren, & Dr. Dre]
Pull your goddamn ass over right now!
Aw shit, now what the fuck you pullin' me over for?
'Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!
Man, fuck this shit
Alright, smart-ass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident?

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash spot for the so-called law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm saying, ""Fuck you, punk!""
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'ma smoke 'em now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'ma turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound (*Gunshots*)
Yeah, somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Takin' out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say
[Chorus]
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck—
Fuck the police

[Skit 2: Cop, Eazy-E, and Dr. Dre]
*Knocking*
Yeah, man, what you need?
Police, open now (Aww, shit)
We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest (*Battering ram*)
Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em! (Move, motherfucker, move now!)
What the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?
Just shut the fuck up and get your motherfucking ass on the floor! (You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)
But I didn't do shit
Man, just shut the fuck up!
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?
[Verse 3: Eazy-E & MC Ren]
I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'
Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe 'cause I blast
On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
'Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still, I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
By me or another nigga
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin' off the eight, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say
[Chorus]
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police, fuck—
Fuck the police, fuck— fuck—
Fuck the police (The verdict)

[Skit 3: Dr. Dre, Cop]
The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck, white bread, chicken shit motherfucker
Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!
Get him out of here! (I want justice!)
Get him the fuck out my face! (I want justice!)
Out, right now!
Fuck you, you black motherfuckers!

And I will smash, halo of flies

Far below the clocktowers' height

So come rest your head.""

There's no forgiveness for you! You sick fuck!

To behold the natural gates

Never felt a drop of pain
Until that second in the garden

1332,Sleeping at Last,Hurry,relaxed,"Hurry, hurry
Come quickly
And leave all logic aside
Don't say a word
Just listen carefully to me...

""The world is ours if we could only let it be""

Every move we make
Will trigger another
And evrey small mistake
Will be a messenger...

""The world is ours if we could only let it be
The world is ours if we would only let it be.""

Our lives are weaving like a thread
Within each other, faithfully
Sharing in our joys and miseries
And all that the world can give

Always, always

In the depths of our souls
Flickers of hope will show so clear
Like a pearl in the sea
A pearl in the sea
(the smiles on faces born in farmilliar places
We'll build ourselves islands upon the deepest oceans)

For the last time
This could be the last time
To pull it from the water
To wear around our necks

""The world is ours if we could only let it be
The world is ours if we would only let it be""

„Yo, Lee, hört man, dass ich krank bin? Egal, morgen, morgen Master-Abgabe, ne? Der hier muss noch drauf! Dass ist für dich David. Zu deinem Geburtstag. N' bisschen verspätet, aber besser später als nie!

[Part 1]
Das ist für den Bruder, der Conny den ""Ich bin feucht"" Snap schickte kurz nachdem ich sie auswahl und ihr ihn ausversehen schickte
Im Sommer gibt's in deiner Hütte Barbecue, und ich weiß jedes meiner Geheimnisse ist sicher bei dir, wie ""Fara und Fu""
Wir betrachten unsere Pokale; schmeißen uns bei Business Terminen in Schale, wie die Benz Schlüssel wenn wir nach Hause kommen
Danach wird erst mal im hauseigenen Pool geschwommen. Du bist immer für mich da, brauch ich Rat komm' ich zu dir. Mit 18 gehen wir zu deiner Oma und bald kannst auch du, zum Barbier.Uns wurden schon genügend Zeichnen gegeben, es steht außer Frage wir sind Brüder für's Leben. Mit dir verbringe ich meine letzten Tage. Für den Fall dass du in' Knast musst, weißt du deiner Frau und Kindern geht es gut bei mir. Deine Kinder bekommen Mäntel aus Kashmir. Deiner Frau gehört der ganze juwelier, und das ganze mache ich ""avec plaisir"". Von Kanada nach Finnland kommen sie in meinem Privat Jet, dass finden sie fett, wie den Mustafa Muhammed. Dem seine Kehle wird durchtrennt , und du weißt von deinem Geld fehlt kein Cent. Denn das geht alles auf meinen Nacken, wie meine Goldketten, ran an die Bouletten!

Doch bei so nem' Typen wie dir, ist alles im Lot, da haben sich die Anforderungen schnell verflogen, wie n' Amateur Pilot
Ich kauf' dir das Lenkrad, dann wirst du Trucker. T.T.T. ; legendary; ""Surprise motherfucker!""

[Part 2]
Unsere Konten sind fett bestückt, wie die 747 von Galileo. Wir schauten sein Video zur selben Zeit, sowas ist bei uns keine Seltenheit. Ich studier' Chemie und bin in der Materie, wie der Konflikt mit Pakistans Infanterie. Wir ficken alles was nicht bei drei auf m' Baum ist ,wie ein Koalabär. Bitch, wir sind legendär und mit 20 schon Milliardär. Wir cruisen auf unserer Yacht im Mittelmeer. Und haben brasilianische Bitches an Bord, wie ein Karnevalswagen von den du Opfer geil wirst, wie von Susana Almeidas Wettervorhersagen
Meine Schwester kam nachts um zwei bei T.T.T. oft in mein Zimmer rein, hab' ich mein Führerschein, hol' ich dich immer ab. Ömer auf mein' Döner bitte kein Ketchup!
Spaß Brudi, ich hab dich lieb auch wenn ich manchmal übertrieb. Ich verzeih' dir alles, und könnte dir nie böse sein. Wer dich anstresst, dem sein Kopf landet auf dem Bordstein!

As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago morning
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another little hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto

[Verse 2]
People, don't you understand
A child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way

[Verse 3]
Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto

[Verse 4]
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto
[Verse 5]
Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, He steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries

[Bridge]
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto

[Verse 6]
And as her young man dies
On a cold and gray Chicago morning
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto

And his mama cries

Signore, il suo sentiero
Quando a te la sua anima
E al mondo la sua pelle
Dovrà riconsegnare
Quando verrà al tuo cielo
Là dove in pieno giorno
Risplendono le stelle

Quando attraverserà
L'ultimo vecchio ponte
Ai suicidi dirà
Baciandoli alla fronte
Venite in Paradiso
Là dove vado anch'io
Perché non c'è l'inferno
Nel mondo del buon Dio

Fate che giunga a Voi
Con le sue ossa stanche
Seguito da migliaia
Di quelle facce bianche
Fate che a voi ritorni
Fra i morti per oltraggio
Che al cielo ed alla terra
Mostrarono il coraggio
Signori benpensanti
Spero non vi dispiaccia
Se in cielo, in mezzo ai Santi
Dio, fra le sue braccia
Soffocherà il singhiozzo
Di quelle labbra smorte
Che all'odio e all'ignoranza
Preferirono la morte
Dio di misericordia
Il tuo bel Paradiso
Lo hai fatto soprattutto
Per chi non ha sorriso
Per quelli che han vissuto
Con la coscienza pura
L'inferno esiste solo
Per chi ne ha paura
Meglio di lui nessuno
Mai ti potrà indicare
Gli errori di noi tutti
Che puoi e vuoi salvare

Have you ever had everything you'd ever wanted
A good life, good friends and a loving companion
Well take a hard look and pay real close attention
I threw it all away with reckless abandon
On a pair of caramel eyes
I found out how quickly I'd learned to lie

Don't judge me til you've walked a mile in my shoes
Things aren't always as they seem
Cause being with him was like falling asleep
Going home was like waking from some kind of dream
The kind that you hope never ends
But real life is not something I can suspend

1354,Kanye West,Through The Wire,happy,"[Music Video - Intro]
Last October Grammy-nominated producer KANYE WEST was in a nearly fatal car accident. His jaw was fractured in nearly three places. Two weeks later he recorded this song with his mouth still wired shut... so the world could feel his pain!

[Intro]
Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye to the…
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man
[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I really apologize for everything right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had, um
That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin
I said, ""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?""
""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!""
You can't be serious, man

'Cause you're pacing at an open door, you're waiting and you can't come in

Why do you make up all these stories
Made up your mind, decided for me

I can tell by the way you walk you wanna be alone with him

When you called me on the telephone I knew that you were miles away
'Cause the words that you said to me weren't hiding what you couldn't say

Plans sort of changed up for the weekend
Friend came to town been years since I seen him

I can tell by the way you talk you wanna be alone with him (alone with him)

(Ooh alone with him)
(Ooh alone with him)
(Ooh alone with him)
(Ooh alone with him)

He was in my dreams
What else could it mean

When you laugh at me behind my back I'll turn and you can run away
Will you tell him all the special things you told me you could never say
I never said I'd be yours only, I didn't know until you told me
If I go I won't be lonely, if I stay now you don't own me

I can tell by the way you smile your love is changing on a whim

Maybe I will and maybe I won't
Maybe I do and maybe I don't
Maybe I will and maybe I won't

1357,Emily Jane White,The Demon,sad,"If there was a demon would you hold her?
And be a nurse by her side?
I'll take a corset of your words
Tie them up high and bind them
You seem like you've always been
Wrote a book that's already been read

And if there was a beast would you hold him?
And be a doctor by his side?
He'll take the drugs that you've stolen
You'll be drunk on electric wine
Oh this town you've never seen before
There's always big guns at your door
The sentiment of class is blood born

I'd like to write a song for you
With arms wide open the way I do
And I'd like to tell the truth to you
Shot through the chest the way I do

1358,Megadeth,Promises,angry,"[Verse 1]
Two hearts that shouldn't
Talk to each other become close
In a town much like a prison cell
People speak our names
On the street in hushed tones
Oh, the stories they'd tell
If anyone would listen
If anyone would listen...

[Verse 2]
You come from a town where
People don't bother saying ""Hello""
Unless somebody's born or dies
And I come from a place where they
Drag your hopes through the mud
Because their own dreams are all dying

[Pre-Chorus]
And when we walk down the street
The wind sings our name in rebel songs
The sounds of the night should make us anxious
But it's much too late when the fear is gone

[Chorus]
I will meet you in the next life (I promise you)
Where we can be together (I promise you)
I will wait 'til then in Heaven (I promise you)
I promise, I promise
[Verse 3]
There's so many fighting
To get past the Pearly Gates
But nobody ever wants to die or get saved
Their intentions aren't that good
And I can smell the asphalt
That's their personal road to Hell being paved

[Pre-Chorus]
And when we walk down the street
The wind sings our name in rebel songs
And it's much too late when the fear is gone

[Chorus]
I will meet you in the next life (I promise you)
Where we can be together (I promise you)
I will wait 'til then in Heaven (I promise you)
I promise, I promise

Soft drifted snow
Death white
I’d like to know
Why she hates
All that she does
But she gives
It all that she’s got

Until the sky turns green
The grass is several shades of blue
Every member of Parliament trips on glue
Until the sky turns green
And the grass is several shades of blue
Every member of Parliament trips on glue

It takes all these things
And all that time
Till my sugar spun sister’s happy
With this love of mine
It’ll take all these things
And oh much more

I’ve paid
For fifteen or more
But my guts
Can’t take many more
My hands
Are stuck to my jeans
And she knows, she knows
What this must mean
She wakes up with the sun
She asked me what is all the fuss
As she gave me more than she thought she should
She wakes up with the sun
I think, what have I done?
As I gave her more than I thought I would

It takes all these things
And all that time
Till my sugar spun sister’s happy
With this love of mine

1361,Deep Forest,Forest Hymn,relaxed,"Farewell, now, my sister
Up ahead there lies your road
And your conscience walks beside you
It's the best friend you'll ever know
And the past is now your future
It bears witness to your soul
Make sure that the love you offer up
Does not fall on barren soil
For the wind cries of late
In the whispering grass
Our way of life is held
In the spinning wheels of chance
I believe in a way of long ago
And the sounds I believe rose our glow
And we're changing our ways
Yes, we are taking on different roads
Tell me more about the forest
That you once called home
For the wind cries of late
In the whispering leaves
And the sun will turn to waste
The heavens we build above
Father, teach your children
To treat our mother well
If we give her back her diamonds
She will offer up her pearl
We must sing her creation song
Jeune du monde
Invoke the spirits that feed us
This dreaming takes too long
But I'm not bitter, no, I'm surviving
To face the world, to raise the future
So why don't you tell me, come on and tell me
About the world you left behind
Can you tell me?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",new age

1363,DMX,Ready To Meet Him,sad,"[Part 1: Prayer II]

Let us pray...
I thank you, Lord, for my birth and everything that's followed
I thank you, Lord, for today, and I will pray for tomorrow
I thank you, Lord, for the love of my life and a friend
I made a promise and I'm lovin' my wife 'til the end
I thank you, Lord, for your guidance, 'cause it's all that counts
And right here, right now... Lord, this is your house
I thank you, Lord, for a dream that came true to light
And I ask you to bless everybody in this room tonight
I don't always do the right thing and I ask you to forgive me
'Cause I need You here wit me, without You in my life it's empty
I think back how some people did me like, violence was the remedy
And because I think of that now, I pray for my enemy
Not because of what I'll do, but because they don't know
There's somethin' better after here, but everybody won't go
So I ask You to forgive them and we'll hope they see
And I thank You for the love that they've given to me
I will not abuse it nor will I lead them astray
You see I love 'em like children, that I see everyday
And I pray... no, we pray... together
Get us through the bad weather, and we love You forever
Let Your thought and my heart go hand in hand
I first thought but to start, but I stand a man
And for as long as I can, as long as You permit me
Please give me the strength I need to live, bear with me
Amen

'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord

[Verse 1]
Lord, You left me stranded and I don't know why
Told me to live my life, now I'm ready to die
Ready to fly, I cry, but I shed no tears
You told me You would dead those fears, it's been years
Snakes still comin' at me, just missin'
Sometimes I think all You do with me is just listen
I thought that I was special, that's what You told me
Hold me, stop actin' like You don't know me
What I do so bad that it sent You away from me?
Not only sent You away, but made You stay away from me?
""My child I'm here as I've always been
It is you who went away and now are back again
What did I say?"" Follow Your word and be true
""What did you do?"" Well, what I wanted to do
""What have you seen?"" Darkness and hell at a glance
""What do you want?"" All I want is another chance

I'm ready to meet him

But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord

[Verse 2]
""Just because you went away, my doors are not locked
Wanna come back home? All you gotta do is knock""
You see, I left home a boy but returned as a man
Full grown and I'm still not able to stand
""I gave you a hand."" Well but I was lookin' the wrong way
Figured out the plan, then I started to pray
And that prayer took me from here, over there
Back to over here, now it got me like where
Do I belong, do I fit in?
Things on my mind, where do I begin?
It's easier to sin, but it hurts my heart
I'm really tryna win, so where do we start?
""Thou shalt not steal."" But what if he stole from me?
""Thou shalt not kill."" But what if he's tryin' to kill me?
""Thou shalt not take my name in vain
No matter how hard it rains, withstand the pain""

'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war

I'm ready to meet him
'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
I'm ready to meet him

[Verse 3]
Our Father, who art in Heaven
I'm not ashamed to ask for guidance at 27
No longer afraid to knock on Your door
Not scared anymore to lose my life in the war
After what I just saw, I'm ridin' with the Lord
'Cause I really can't afford to lose my head by the sword
And now that I've seen what I need to see
Please take me where I need to be
""What have you learned?"" It's better to tell the truth than to lie
""What have you learned?"" To love my life until I die
""What have you learned?"" Violence isn't always the key
""What have you learned?"" You can't always believe what you see
""What have you learned?"" It's better to forgive and forget
""What have you learned?"" Give as you expect to get
""What have you learned?"" That I can't go on without You
""What have you learned?"" I must've been a fool to ever doubt You

[Chorus]
I'm ready to meet him
'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
I'm ready to meet him
'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white

1365,Skinny Puppy,Candle,sad,"Here falls now undone
Looks beyond the credits sum
Livid fractures less of fate
The whisper winds blow the seeds of hate

Disturbed society
Dogs might turn with no values
Intend to raise ability
A tried and tested pointless view
God's got security
Hands like snakes sow the seeds

Raise all negative force-fed
Traces poisons all impure
Profane the haunted heaven
Jeering leapt into the pit of calamity
A mean condition no wealth dents
Provisions for a time unknown
Thelemic gestures are planned and hatched
In seasons of dissolute pain

I cried afflicted and infected
Oblige the system's perfect dream
Distorted my words
Assume all that is programmed before me
And somewhat left unsaid behind shutters
Dirt before desire
Dusted crap ingested comes
Stealing life that you are not visited
Warped torpedo night crawls through
The distant and irrelevant
A good life’s experiment fused

I'm laying violent hands upon
A dead card calling cattle
The playthings are so abused
The derelict dial phone clock pusher
Delved in reliving the future too

I'm sticking pins and needles
In this stinging rotten flesh-like substitute
Pieces of half cooked meat that are

There's not a bad thing you can say about them they've not said When they're alone
Pick up the phone

I will laugh and I will cry
And I'll take comfort in that someday I shall die
I will laugh and I will cry

1369,Cure,Killing an Arab,angry,"[Verse 1]
Standing on the beach
With a gun in my hand
Staring at the sky
Staring at the sand
Staring down the barrel
At the arab on the ground
I can see his open mouth
But I hear no sound

[Chorus]
I'm alive
I'm dead
I'm the stranger
Killing an arab

[Verse 2]
I can turn
And walk away
Or I can fire the gun
Staring at the sky
Staring at the sun
Whichever I chose
It amounts to the same
Absolutely nothing
[Chorus]
I'm alive
I'm dead
I'm the stranger
Killing an arab

[Verse 3]
I feel the steel butt jump
Smooth in my hand
Staring at the sea
Staring at the sand
Staring at myself
Reflected in the eyes
Of the dead man on the beach
(The dead man on the beach)

[Chorus]
I'm alive
I'm dead
I'm the stranger

1370,Laura Fygi,Dream A Little Dream,relaxed,"Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper, ""I love you""
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
""Dream a little dream of me""

Just say ""goodnight"" and kiss me
Oh, hold me tight and tell me you miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, my dear
Just saying this:

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they'll be
Dream a little dream of me

Say ""nightie-night"" and kiss me
Oh, hold me tight and tell me you miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be

1372,Simon & Garfunkel,Patterns,relaxed,"[Verse 1]
The night sets softly
With the hush of falling leaves
Casting shivering shadows
On the houses through the trees
And the light from a street lamp
Paints a pattern on my wall
Like the pieces of a puzzle
Or a child's uneven scrawl

[Verse 2]
Up a narrow flight of stairs
In a narrow little room
As I lie upon my bed
In the early evening gloom
Impaled on my wall
My eyes can dimly see
The pattern of my life
And the puzzle that is me

[Verse 3]
From the moment of my birth
To the instant of my death
There are patterns I must follow
Just as I must breathe each breath
Like a rat in a maze
The path before me lies
And the pattern never alters
Until the rat dies
[Verse 4]
And the pattern still remains
On the wall where darkness fell
And it's fitting that it should
For in darkness I must dwell
Like the color of my skin
Or the day that I grow old
My life is made of patterns
That can scarcely be controlledEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

There she stands, this lovely creature
There she stands, there she stands
With her hair full of ribbons
And green gloves on her hands
So I asked this lovely creature
Yes, I asked. Yes I asked
Would she walk with me a while
Through this night so vast
She took my hand, this lovely creature
""Yes"", she said, ""Yes"", she said
""Yes, I'll walk with you a while""
It was a joyful man she led

[Verse 2]
Over hills, this lovely creature
Over mountains, over ranges
By great pyramids and sphinxs
We met drifters and strangers
Oh the sands, my lovely creature
And the mad, moaning winds
At night the deserts writhed
With diabolical things
Through the night, through the night
The wind lashed and it whipped me
When I got home, my creature
Was no longer with me
Somewhere she lies, this lovely creature
Beneath the slow drifting sands
With her hair full of ribbons
And green gloves on her handsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

Fusion of the five elements, to search for the higher intelligence
Women walk around celibate, livin' irrelevant
The most benevolent king, communicatin' through your dreams
Mental pictures been painted, Allah's heard and seen
Everywhere, throughout your surrounding atmosphere
Troposphere, thermosphere, stratosphere
Can you imagine from one single idea, everything appeared here
Understanding makes my truth, crystal clear
Innocent black immigrants locked in housing tenements
Eighty-Five percent tenants dependent welfare recipients
Stapleton's been stamped as a concentration camp
At night I walk through, third eye as bright as a street lamp
Electric microbes, robotic probes
Takin' telescope pictures of globe
Babies gettin' pierced with microchips stuffed inside they earlobes
Then examinated, blood contaminated
Vaccinated, lives fabricated
Exaggerated authorization, Food and Drug Administration
Testin' poison in prison population
My occupation to stop the inauguration of Satan
Some claim that it was Reagan, so I come to slay men
Like Bartholomew, 'cause every particle is physical article
Was diabolical to the last visible molecule
A spaceknight like Rom, consume planets like Unicron
Blasting photon bombs from the arm like Galvatron
[Verse 2: U-God]
United Nations, gun bias style patient
Formulating rap plural a capella occupation
Conquer land like Napoleon, military bomb fest
We want sanitary food, planetary conquest
Thug peoples on some hardco' body shit
Get your shit together 'fore the fuck Illuminati hit
Dreams is free and escape is sleep
For a fool peep jewels, keep tools for tough time
The rule of rough mind, elevate, stay behind
The sun gotta shine, keep on, cremate
The whole Babylon, times up, move on
Kings on your pawn, checkmate, no fakes
Supposed through the gate, case closed things get froze
When it comes time, chosen ones will hold the guns
We take flight with no fright
And attack, never fear 'cause our words is clear
What's been done can't be undone, son, we can't care
'Cause the last days and times are surely here
Snakes and flakes get blown, by the righteous ones
Divine minds bind, we unified as one
Half of black folk, we half broke, smoke a bowl of weed shit
Our everlastin' essence stay flyin' over Egypt

Impossible, you can never defeat the gods

Everybody get the fuck back, excuse me, bitch, gimme your jack

Blood comin' out his mouth, he bleedin' badly
Nahhh, Jamie, don't start that shit
Keep your head up, if you escape hell, we gettin' fucked up
When we was eight, we went to Bat Day to see the Yanks
In '69, his father and mines, they robbed banks
He pointed to the charm on his neck
With his last bit of energy left, told me rock it with respect
I opened it, seen the God holdin' his kids
Photogenic, tears just burst out my wig
Plus he dropped one
Oh shit, here come his Old Earth with no shoes on
Screamin', holdin' her breasts with a gown on
She fell and then lightly touched his jaw, kissed him
Rubbed his hair, turned around, the ambulance was there
Plus the blue coats, Officer Lough, took it as a joke
Weeks ago he strip-searched the God and gave him back his coke
Bitches yellin', Beenie Man swung on Helen
In the back of a cop car, Dirty Tasha tellin'
But suddenly, a chill came through, it was weird
Felt like my man, was cast out my heaven now we share
Laid on the stretcher, blood on his Wally's like ketchup
Deep like the Paul assassination with a sketch of it
It can't be, from Yoo-hoo to Lee's
Second grade humped the teachers, about to leave
Finally, this closed chapter comes to an end
He was announced, pronounced dead, y'all, at 12:10

Now what my man is tryin' to tell y'all
Is that across the whole globe
The murder rates is increasin', and we decreasin'

Walking another sleepless dream
And now everything I leave behind
I leave for you

Look into the mirror, what am I?
A frightened creature locked inside
My mother's hair, my father's eyes
Memories, time rearranged for you
Is everything changed for you?
Do they make it better?

But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree, fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
But I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me, you obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick out of youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",easy listening

Fuck with me, I'll put my foot in your ass
See, I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?

And don't hold a fuckin' thing back

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Homies all standin' around, just hangin'
Some dope-dealin', some gang-bangin'
We decide to roll and we deep
See a nigga on Dayton's and we creep
Real slow and before you know
I had my shotgun pointed in the window
He got scared and hit the gas
Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rollin', I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to the fort
Sweatin' all the bitches in the biker shorts
We didn't get no play from the ladies
With six niggas in a car—are you crazy?
She was scared, and it was showin'
We all said ""Fuck you, bitch!"" and kept goin'
To the hood, and we was fin to
Find somethin' else to get into
Like some pussy, or in fact
A bum rush, but we call it rat pack
On a nigga for nothin' at all
Ice Cube'll go stupid when I'm full of eight ball
I might stumble, but still won't lose
Now I'm dressed in the county blues
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you fuck with me, I'll put my foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?

Man, what'cha gon' do now?

How far you goin' back? (Way back)
""As we go a lil' somethin' like this""—hit it!

Here's a little gangsta, short in size
A t-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
Built like a tank, yet hard to hit
Ice Cube and Eazy-E cold runnin' shit

[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
Well, I'm Eazy-E, the one they're talkin' about
Nigga tried to roll the dice and just crapped out
Police tried to roll, so it's time to go
I creeped away real slow and jumped in the six-fo'
With the {diamond in the back, sun-roof top}
Diggin' the scene with the gangsta lean
'Cause I'm the E, I don't slang or bang
I just smoke motherfuckers like it ain't no thang
And all you bitches, you know I'm talkin' to you
""We want to fuck you, Eazy!"" I want to fuck you too
Because you see, I don’t really take no shit
So let me tell you motherfuckers who you're fuckin' with
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you fuck with me, I'll put a foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'

Choking, sinking, deeper into this ocean

Screaming, crying for someone to save me

My only sin
Was to kill a man
Deep was my pain
But I'd do the same again
Beat it out, out of me, cut me up and watch me bleed
Strike me down, cast me out
Throw me into the ocean's mouth

1390,Ice Cube,How to Survive in South Central,angry,"[Intro]
And now, the wonderous world of..
Hey, come to Los Angeles!
Where you and your family can have peace and tranquility
Enjoy the refinement..
Hey Bone, hey nigga where you at though?
Hello, my name is Elaine
And I'll be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
How to survive in South Central (what you do?)
A place where bustin a cap is fundamental
No, you can't find the shit in a handbook
Take a close look, at a rap crook
Rule number one: get yourself a gun
A nine in your ass'll be fine
Keep it in your glove compartment
Cause jackers (yo) they love to start shit
Now if you're white you can trust the police
But if you're black they ain't nothin but beasts
Watch out for the kill
Don't make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
And don't get smart
Answer all questions, and that's your first lesson
On stayin alive
In South Central, yeah, that's how you survive
[Break]
Hi, this is Elaine again
Are you enjoying your stay in South Central Los Angeles?
Or has somebody taken your things?
Have you witnessed a driveby?
Okay, make sure you have your camcorder ready
To witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police
So you and your family can enjoy this tape, over and over again
This is Los Angeles, this is Los Angeles

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Rule number two: don't trust nobody
Especially a bitch, with a hooker's body
Cause it ain't nuttin but a trap
And females'll get you jacked and kidnapped
You'll wind up dead
Just to be safe don't wear no blue or red
Cause most niggas get got
In either L.A., Compton or Watts
Pissed off black human beings
So I think you better skip the sight-seeing
And if you're nuttin but a mark
Make sure that you're in before dark
But if you need some affection, mate
Make sure the bitch ain't a Section 8
Cause if so that's a monkey-wrench ho
And you won't survive in South Central
[Break]
Now you realize it's not all that it's cracked up to be
You realize that it's fucked up!
It ain't nothin like the shit you saw on TV
Palm trees and blonde bitches?
I'd advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on, punk motherfucker!
And you'll get your ass straight smoked
Yo I wanna say whassup to DJ Chilly Chill, Sir Jinx
Aiy'yo Cube these motherfuckers don't know what time it is
So show these motherfuckers what's happenin'
Tell these motherfuckers, don't fuck around in South Central
God dammit!

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Rule number three: don't get caught up
Cause niggas are doing anything that's thought up
And they got a price
On everything from dope, to stolen merchandise
Weed to sherm
Cause South Central L.A., is one big germ
Waitin for a brother like you to catch a disease
And start slangin ki's
To an undercover or the wrong brother
And they'll smother, a out of town motherfucker
So don't take your life for granted
Cause it's the craziest place on the planet
In L.A., heroes don't fly through the sky of stars
They live behind bars
So everybody's doin' a little dirt
And it's the youngsters puttin' in the most work
So be alert and stay calm
As you enter, the concrete Vietnam
You say, the strong survive
Shit, the strong even die, in South Central
[Outro]
Yeah you bitches, you think I forgot about your ass you tramp-ass hoes?
You better watch out
And for you so called baller-ass niggas, you know what time it is
South Central ain't no joke
Got to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers
Better keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip god dammit
You'll sho' get got, just like that
This ain't no joke motherfuckers
Now I wanna send a shout-out to E-Dog, the engineer
Puttin' his two cents in

This is Los Angeles8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",hip hop

Silence
The world is still sleeping
Nobody but me and the candlelight
I see the shadow of the flame
My breathing makes it play
On your face my love on the picture
On the wall…

First sunray
The world is creeping in
Another lonely day with it standing on my way
The twinkle in your eye
Appears to me in light
Would you take my hand
And lead me through without a fight

Another worthless day
Nowhere to go nowhere to feel at home
Another lonely day
I need your love can't make it on my own

With news that makes me cryEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

Do you feel the same weed high that I feel??
Cuz I'm so high (reefer makes you feel that way)
And I feeling so right
Roll (roll), let's smoke, I got to get high
I been high since the last song (off that la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
And I just been smokin' and smokin'
Smoke another blunt, roll another up
You know that weed can really ease your mind
Every time I smoke good reefer that indo high makes me fly
If everyboby smoked a blunt, relieve the mind, the world could
Be a better place
If everybody took a break and we all just got wasted
Toked out (out, out out), smoked out (out, out, out)
Choked out (out, out, out), pull another O (out, out, out)
Let's get P-O-D-ded (P-O-D-ded, P-O-D-ded)

20 dollar hollars, all day, everyday
Come around my way, you gone want to stay
Weed makes me hungry, happy, and all I can say
Sure I need some more
Don't make we wait, stay awake, fake sleep
Got the weed between the sheets
Catch me, Mary J. blessed me
Open up the dime, stimulate your mind, slide my thumb up the blunt
Open up and what you'll find in there (you don't really want)
I never been in High Times (I never been in High Yimes)
I never been in High Times
But can you tell me that I've been so high all my life
Am I high enough (am I high enough)
Am I high enough (am I high enough)
[Verse 3: Wish Bone]
I remember being a little thug
Weed, really didn't know what it was
Then I took a puff and I realized
I should always, stay high
The weed (the weed), makes me feel alright (alright)
If you feel like I feel, I got half on yo dime
If you got weed smoke it, I'm a real weed smoker
If it's mine then I would
Since its yours you could, you should
If I ain't there when you blaze a blunt nigga huh, please think of me
Cuz you know I nigga like to get high (high), high and free
Smokin' all night, feelin' all right
Bone Thugs get high, so high
High, high, all night, high, high

[Verse 4: Flesh-N-Bone]
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my my my my
I know you wonder why I do it. Love the sky
And I soar up so high
This mornin' I was in my bed
Bangin' and ringin' inside my head
I wanted to make love to you baby, but last night I got P-O-Ded instead
So please don't go away, that's all I got to say
Is I gotta have you mary j
Such a heavenly feelin' I get when I'm taking fat ass blunts to the brain
Oh darlin' I'm goin insane, and I really wish we can
Kick it at home in America, like it was on in Amsterdam
You heard enough, you heard it all, nothin' but a, a really thug nigga
Nothin' less than a killa, I'm out in front makin' my scrilla
I'm happy to know , the slide is the ball, and kick as strong as me
You rippin' the bong like me, can't hit it as long as me
[Verse 5: Layzie Bone]
And when I need to free my mind
I can find, satisfaction in a bag of weed
Everything I need, leave it to the trees
It can make me feel better, and every day I wake
Niggas rollin' up blunts, and mo blunts, and mo blunts
And I keep a case of Swisher Sweets in the trunk
So when I'm rollin', smokin', chokin', just floatin'
Through the city in my drop top
Glock cocked, rollin', just rollin'
Me and mary jane
Its my world, its my thang
The way she penetrates my brain
Buddah, done blessed me with game
Good game, you wanna chop it up
We can kick it, smoke a fatty to the dome
Nigga lay high, thugged out, smokin', all, night, long

And the riverbed shall not be your home""

I walked on and I learned later
That this navy blue bird was me
I returned a paler blue bird

You must fly closer to the sea""

I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

[Chorus 1]
The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

[Verse 2]
I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules
[Chorus 2]
The gods may throw the dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain?

[Verse 3]
But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed

[Chorus 3]
The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always staying low
The game is on again
A lover or a friend?
A big thing or a small?
The winner takes it all
[Verse 1 variation]
I don't wanna talk
'Cause it makes me feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence
But you see

[Chorus 3 variation]
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all
The game is on again
A lover or a friend?
A big thing or a small?
The winner takes it all

1406,G. Love & Special Sauce,Relax,relaxed,"Let's all just relax
And get into this groove
The room's starting to move
Now turn the red lights on
You know the kind that I like
Deep blues and reds
With purple highlights
But don't forget my oohhs
And fade in my ahhs
Fade out the parades
And the charades
Making music like love is made
And lovers wait patiently
And with joy
For the right moment
To explor in passion
Why everlasting love is everlasting
But don't forget my oohhs
And fade in my ahhs
Ther's no need to argue for better position
Realize the moment that you're in is magic
Stellare regions cry everything has it's season
Everything happens for a reason
So who are we to worry at any rate
The plane that crashed
We missed 'cause we were running late
And if success eludes you
Then you must choose to do
What other people wouldn't do
But don't forget my oohhs
And fade in my ahhs
So as cold night fades into darkness
Harken to the fire
Where you may find some peace
As many people pass
Some good and some bad
But this fire glows stronger yet
And burning bright reminds us
To ever be reborn
The sun sets soon
Uprises the moon
The sun sets soon
Uprises the moonEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",country

The duchess to reveal her face

For your gallantry at tomorrow's gate

So I won't let one more day pass without you

Then you don't needa be with me
And I don't need to hold on

Got a high threshold for pain

1416,The Doors,Celebration of the Lizard,angry,"Lions in the street and roaming
Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming
A beast caged in the heart of a city
The body of his mother
Rotting in the summer ground
He fled the town
He went down South and crossed the border
Left chaos and disorder
Back there over his shoulder
One morning he awoke in a green hotel
With a strange creature groaning beside him
Sweat oozed from its shining skin
Is everybody in? Is everybody in?
Is everybody in?
The ceremony is about to begin
Wake up!
You can't remember where it was
Had this dream stopped?
The snake was pale gold, glazed and shrunken
We were afraid to touch it
The sheets were hot dead prisms
And she was beside me
Old, she's no, young
Her dark red hair, the white soft skin
Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom
Look! she's coming in here
I can't live through each slow century of her moving
I let my cheek slide down, the cool smooth tile
Feel the good cold stinging blood
The smooth hissing snakes of rain
Once I had a little game
I liked to crawl back in my brain
I think you know, the game I mean
I mean the game, called, 'Go insane'
You should try this little game
Just close your eyes forget your name
Forget the world, forget the people
And we'll erect, a different steeple
This little game is fun to do
Just close your eyes, no way to lose
And I'm right there, I'm going too
Release control, we're breaking through
Way back deep into the brain
Back where there's never any pain
And the rain falls gently on the town
And over the heads of all of us
And in the labyrinth of streams
Beneath, the quiet unearthly presence of
Gentle hill dwellers, in the gentle hills around
Reptiles abounding
Fossils, caves, cool air heights
Each house repeats a mold, windows rolled
Beast car locked in against morning
All now sleeping
Rugs silent, mirrors vacant
Dust Lying under the beds of lawful couples
Wound in sheets
And daughters, smug
With semen eyes in their nipples
Wait
There's been a slaughter here
Don't stop to speak or look around
Your gloves and fan are on the ground
We're getting out of town, we're going on the run
And you're the one I want to come
Not to touch the earth
Not to see the sun
Nothing left to do, but
Run, run, run
Let's run, let's run
House upon the hill, moon is lying still
Shadows of the trees
Witnessing the wild breeze
C'mon baby run with me
Let's run
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run
The mansion is warm at the top of the hill
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs
And you won't know a thing till you get inside
Dead President's corpse in the driver's car
The engine runs on glue and tar
C'mon along, we're not going very far
To the East to meet the Czar
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run
Some outlaws lived by the side of the lake
The minister's daughter's in love with the snake
Who lives in a well by the side of the road

We should see the gates by mornin'
We should be inside by evening

The rivers and highways
We came down from
Forests and falls
We came down from
Carson and Springfield
We came down from
Phoenix enthralled
And I can tell you
The names of the Kingdom
I can tell you
The things that you know
Listening for a fistful of silence
Climbing valleys into the shade
For seven years, I dwelt
In the loose palace of exile
Playing strange games with the girls of the island
Now, I have come again
To the land of the fair and the strong and the wise
Brothers and sisters of the pale forest
Children of night
Who among you will run with the hunt?

And sharing my time
Letting someone into my misery
I told it all step by step

How I landed on the island
And how I swim across the sea
And it crosses my mind
That I may awake to a knife in me
No more breath in my hair or ladies underwear
Tossed up over the alarm clock
Blood dripping from the bed to a neatly written poem
Heartfelt last line reading
There is no more mystery
Is it going to happen, my love?
There is no more mystery
Is it going to happen, my love?

""It's all in my head"", she said, ""Morning after nightmare""
""You're building a wall"", she said, ""Higher than the both of us
So try living life instead of hiding in the bedroom
Show me a smile and I'll promise not to leave you""

It happened under a rainy cloud
Passing through the dark South
We went into a big house
And slept in a small bed
I didn't know you then
As well as you of me
We talked of our sad lives
And we went on separately

And we went on separately
I found your overseas souvenirs
Holiday greeting cards
Those long forgotten high school fears
""It's all in my head"", I said
Banging on the piano
I've not been so alone
I thought, since kicking in the womb
I drank so much tea
I wrote my letters in kanji
Around the block I walked and walked
Pretending you were with me

Not wanting to die out here
Without you

The hurting never ends
Like birthdays and old friends, we forget
That this flesh blood and bone is human
Trading phone lines for airlines
Unwilling to face
That love is found on the inside
Not the outside
And like a medicine bottle
In the cabinet, I'll keep you
And like a medicine bottle
In my hand I will hold you

And swallow you slowly
As to last me a lifetime
Without holding too tight
I do not want to lose

The thrill that it gives me
To look out from my window
And scowl at the houses
From my world in the bedroom

It's all in his head, she read
In a girlfriend's self-help book
It's all his own making
A war with himself

Like two sides of a wall
That separates two countries
He shuts out the world he once knew
To love you

1421,Au Revoir Simone,I Couldn't Sleep,relaxed,"I couldn't sleep
Didn't want comforting
Just company to sleep

And then in dreams we meet
And stay asleep

I awoke feeling restless
Didn't know quite where I was
Though I felt far away and cold
It was so late but my mind was curious
It was quiet, snowing with frosted windows
I had a book but wasn't reading just watching you

Didn't want comforting
Just company, oh be sweet
It could go either way
Based on what they say

I didn't wish to be somewhere else
Your face was comforting to me
I don't remember you smiling
But just the same
I didn't know you
You didn't know what to make of me
It was peaceful that night
A kind of friendship all too seriousEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

Screams of lust we cry
Tonight you are everything
You're everything...
You're everything to me no more
As I wake from this perfect dream
I'll escape from Eden's walls
Can I not stay and live this lie?
For I must think only of myself
And to think that you would not be scared or surprised if I'd severed all these ties
This is the end...
I'll lose myself in anguish for tonight
Help me get over you

I feel so numb to see this bitter end
(It has come to this...) End of beautiful illusions
Broken pieces will not mend
One last kiss to save our past now

I'll lose myself in anguish for tonight
Help me get over you
One last false apology
Help me get over you
Now we must let go
Urgency overwhelms me as I must restrain my flood of tears
I refuse to be slave to your false beauty again

I'll lose myself in anguish for tonight
Help me get over you
One last false apology
Help me get over you

In my mind blood drips from your eyes
A beautiful last goodbye2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",metal

'Til the rights to you are sold

Think I go and start my car
To have the real adventure
Like some tacky little creep

Took my stash and left me lonely

As it bathes me in your
Blue midnight glow
I wonder why you're not sleeping

If you could know

Crouched down by a bush at the roadside
I watch as
You pass me by
Lost down by the side of the river
And no light comes
From the empty sky

Tonight
Make it tonight
Tonight
Make it tonight

I left home at midnight
Made for the horizon
No sense of direction
I walked on for miles
Oh I hope that I find you
I hide from the headlamps
No lights in the window
The whole town is sleeping and somewhere you lie
Oh, I wish I could find you
Oh I'm lost by the river
My clothes are in tatters
My face scarred by branches
I shiver with cold
No, I don't think I'll find you

[Intro]
Uno por pobre y feo, home, pero antojao'
Ah, hijueputa

[Verso 1]
Tengo la camisa negra, hoy mi amor está de luto
Hoy tengo en el alma una pena y es por culpa de tu embrujo
Hoy sé que tú ya no me quieres y eso es lo que más me hiere
Que tengo la camisa negra y una pena que me duele

[Pre-Coro]
Mal parece que solo me quedé
Y fue pura todita tu mentira
Qué maldita mala suerte la mía
Que aquel día te encontré
Por beber del veneno malevo de tu amor
Yo quedé moribundo y lleno de dolor
Respiré de ese humo amargo de tu adiós
Y desde que tú te fuiste yo solo tengo

Tengo la camisa negra porque negra tengo el alma
Yo por ti perdí la calma y casi pierdo hasta mi cama
Cama-cama, come on, baby, te digo con disimulo
Que tengo la camisa negra y debajo tengo el difunto

¡Pa' enterrártelo cuando quieras, mamita! ¡Juya!
Así como lo oye, mija

Tengo la camisa negra, ya tu amor no me interesa
Lo que ayer me supo a gloria hoy me sabe a pura
Miércoles por la tarde y tú que no llegas, ni siquiera muestras señas
Y yo con la camisa negra y tus maletas en la puerta

I'm not quite how I should be
Been finding tricks too hard
I'm thinking something must be broken
Cos it wasn't like this before

Now everyone is ugly
And everyone is stoned
Small things about you excite me
But then I'd hate to spoil the tone

[Chorus]
All my little somethings just ran out of luck
Secret dates with strangers, dirty words and fighting talk
I'm so scared it's killed me time and time again
I can't live with compromise, so maybe we can talk as friends?
If at first you don't succeed, try again for me

[Verse 2]
Today is gonna be fine
Tomorrow will be fine too
I asked for things to better me
Even though they silenced my soul

I can taste it just for a second
And then it disappears
The flowers look like glitter
But then, so do you, my dear
[Chorus]
All my little somethings just ran out of luck
Secret dates with strangers, dirty words and fighting talk
I'm so scared it's killed me time and time again
I can't live with compromise, so maybe we can talk as friends?
If at first you don't succeed, try again for me

[Verse 3]
It's in the way that you look
It's in the books that won't read
It comes and goes like a friend
It's with me right till the end

It's in the memories I've lost
It's concentrating too much
It's breaking down of relations
And it's the beat of the clock

It's not being able to explain
Or get your feelings across
It's in the pain that won't leave you
It's coming straight back for us

It's in a new lease of life
And a search that ends well
It's in finding that change
It's being happy againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

1441,Hanne Hukkelberg,Balloon,relaxed,"He still held my hand in his thread
His head filled with helium
Pulled me up so i couldn't walk
But look at things from a different angle

To hang on to my balloon
And to be shown a glimpse of the truth
Made my cheek flush and my mouth smile
My chest's like a cage full of butterflies
It tickled and i laught ""such a rare, rare joy""

Suddenly the balloon loosened itself, he said
""I have to move further on, i'll keep on flying
Keep on showing the truth from my point of view""

I fell down on a cottonpavement painted blue
And i lost the sight, lost the moment and my view
The only truth that I knew, moments swiftly disappearEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",world/traditional

No, nobody's baby, and I've got to know the reason why

He showed her all the things that made a new day new
She kept forgetting but he would help recall
There's more to life than standing when the world wants you to fall

So she needs him badly and now she thinks she's lost
Without the strength he lent, the pillar and the cross
Lies on an island, sleeps in a room
There's no more need for standing when the world won't let you fall

It's wilderness in here, a dune sea stretched for miles
Can't you come home?
It's wilderness in here, a dune sea stretched for miles
Can't you come home?

You made this too

You made this for me alone

Only good things will find us, me and you

The main attraction, distraction
Got ya number than number than numb
Empty ya pockets, son, they got you thinkin' that
What ya need is what they selling
Make you think that buying is rebelling

From the theaters to malls on every shore
The thin line between entertainment and war
The frontline is everywhere
There be no shelter here
Spielberg, the nightmare works so push it far
Amistad was a whip, the truth was feathered and tarred
Memories erased, burned and scarred
Trade in ya history for a VCR

Cinema, simulated life, ill drama
Fourth Reich culture, Americana
Chained to the dream they got you searchin' for
The thin line between entertainment and war

There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)
There be no shelter here (The frontline is everywhere)

Hospitals not profit full
The market bulls got pockets full
To advertise some hip disguise
View the world from American eyes

The poor adore, keep fiendin' for more
The thin line between entertainment and war
They fix the need, develop the taste
Buy their products or get laid to waste

Coca-Cola is back in the veins of Saigon
And Rambo too, he's got a dope pair of Nikes on
Godzilla, pure mothafuckin' filler
To keep ya eyes off the real killer

Cinema, simulated life, ill drama
Fourth Reich culture, Americana
Chained to the dream they got you searchin' for
The thin line between entertainment and war

In a metal dragon lost in time
Skimming waves of an underground sea
In some kind of dreamworld fantasy

Sun a hot circle on a canopy
'25 a racing blot on a bright green sea
Ahead the dim blur of an alien land
Time to give ourselves to strange gods' hands
Dark flak spiders bursting in the sky
Reaching twisted claws on every side
No place to run, no place to hide
No turning back on a suicide ride

Toy city streets crawling through my sights
Sprouting clumps of mushrooms like a world surreal
This dream won't ever, ever end
And time seems like it'll never begin

And if I lose, at least I tried!

[Chorus]
(We) we are the new diabolic
(We) we are the bitter bucolic
If I have to give my life, you can have it
(We) we are the pulse of the maggots
[Verse 2]
I won't be the inconsequential
I won't be the wasted potential
I can make it as severe as I can
Until you realize you'll never take a stand
It isn't just a one-sided version
We've dealt with a manic subversion
I won't let the truth be perverted
And I won't leave another victim deserted

[Chorus]
(We) we are the new diabolic
(We) we are the bitter bucolic
If I have to give my life, you can have it
(We) we are the pulse of the maggots

[Post-Chorus]
(Do you understand?) Yes
(Do you understand?) Yes
(Do you understand?) Yes
(Do you understand?) Yes

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
[Verse 3]
We fight 'til no one can fight us
We live and no one can stop us
We pull when we're pushed too far
And the advantage is, the bottom line is
We never had to fight in the first place
We only had to spit back at their face
We won't walk alone any longer
What doesn't kill us only makes us stronger

[Chorus]
(We) we are the new diabolic
(We) we are the bitter bucolic
If I have to give my life, you can have it
(We) we are the pulse of the maggots

[Post-Chorus]
(Do you understand?) Yes
(Do you understand?) Yes
(Do you understand?) Yes
(Do you understand?) Yes

Say it again, say it again

No, wouldn't just have one hood
A Hollywood mansion if I could
Please book me first class to my fancy house in London town

Annihilation, obliteration
Pulses in these veins
Sheer defiance drives my hostility
I am merciless to the core
Chaotic fury breeds

You got me stressin', incessantly pressin' the issue
'Cause every moment gone, you know I miss you

Yes, it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots and when I see you, it gets so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (Uh-huh), you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight

When there is so much time to miss you
Beautiful changes I've seen sometimes
The clouds changing into reindeer and flying
To places clear of sorrow

Walking around
You know I've had enough of this trouble
Following me high and low. Now it can go

Some boy I knew said, Hang on, stay gold
Before he left here for England
Beautiful changes I feel sometimes
In the middle of the late morning dishes
When You say I might do anything at all

Will we give ourselves a fright

Packed my bags and headed west

And leave this far behind
Can you find the time to take a chance

I've saved them just for you

You're safe with me tonight

While days turn into years

Guilt and honor have crossed over into what's left for holdin' on
You know things are getting hard

Can these qualities remain the same?

In so deep there ain't no judgement day
If there was i think I'd be ok

Hangin' on the back of my will
Waitin' for the moment to be still

1494,Leonard Cohen,Teachers,sad,"I met a woman long ago
Her hair the black that black can go
Are you a teacher of the heart?
Soft she answered no

I met a girl across the sea
Her hair the gold that gold can be
Are you a teacher of the heart?
Yes, but not for thee

I met a man who lost his mind
In some lost place I had to find
Follow me the wise man said
But he walked behind

I walked into a hospital
Where none was sick and none was well
When at night the nurses left
I could not walk at all

Morning came and then came noon
Dinner time a scalpel blade
Lay beside my silver spoon
Some girls wander by mistake
Into the mess that scalpels make
Are you the teachers of my heart?
We teach old hearts to break
One morning I woke up alone
The hospital and the nurses gone
Have I carved enough my Lord?
Child, you are a bone

I ate and ate and ate
No, I did not miss a plate, well
How much do these suppers cost?
We'll take it out in hate

I spent my hatred everyplace
On every work on every face
Someone gave me wishes
And I wished for an embrace

Several girls embraced me, then
I was embraced by men
Is my passion perfect?
No, do it once again

I was handsome, I was strong
I knew the words of every song
Did my singing please you?
No, the words you sang were wrong

Who is it whom I address?
Who takes down what I confess?
Are you the teachers of my heart?
We teach old hearts to rest
Oh teachers, are my lessons done?
I cannot do another one
They laughed and laughed and said, Well child
Are your lessons done?
Are your lessons done?
Are your lessons done?4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",folk/acoustic

Orders fly like bullet stream
Drums and cannons laugh aloud
Whistles come from ashen shroud
Leaders damn the world and roar
But no man can find the war

Is the war across the sea?
Is the war behind the sky?
Have you each and all gone blind:
Is the war inside your mind?

Mankind, in his insatiable search for divine knowledge
Has discarded all Biblical teachings
Realizing that the strength of religion
Is the repression of knowledge
All structures of religion have collapsed
Life prays for death
In the wake of the horror of these revelations

That would be known as the end of creation
Would manifest itself
We believe all this chaos and atrocity can be traced
Back to one single event

All men are not created equal
Only the strong will prosper
Only the strong will conquer
Only in the darkness of Christ have I realized

A scene from a film
Just as familiar
As the love had been

I woke and couldn't sleep
Before a word was said
The gap was ocean deep
Between us in the bed

The end of a love affair
The end of a life
The end of a love affair
Still we both survive

It didn't take so long
Really just a day
And all the hope was gone
It was clear I couldn't say

Getting up is easy
Beaten up, still easy
Cutting off is easy
Tearing down is easy

The end of a love affair
The world is born again
If things doesn't look the same
It's cause they constantly change

Now I'm on my own

The tone was pure and played on gut
From your birdhouse aflame

Your fire burns for me
Red as grace
The blush came easily to your face
Your fire burns for me
Red as grace
And she says that none would have her

As a boy I too drew near
To the love of dust
Toughskin blue light cowboy
Idle hands they rust

Your fire burns for me
Red as grace
The blush came easily to your face
Your fire burns for me
Red as grace
And she says that none would have her
Let us allow the character to build
Wise as serpents and harmless as doves
Let's allow the emptiness to fill
Rich mercy and brotherly love

To what you need the most
You'll find this chemistry could move

Will be there to recieve you

As we watched the regulars rush the big hotels
We kissed again as the showers swept the Florida shore
You opened your umbrella
But we walked between the raindrops back to your door
Oh Miami!

In my dreams I can hear the sound of thunder
I can see the causeway by the big hotels
That happy day we'll find each other on that Florida shore

When you push on glass, it’s bound to break

Even when she was defensive
It just gave me more incentive
The more you squeeze, the more it slips away

I know I've had enough, so tell me that you're not alone

[Chorus: All]
I'm talking 'bout a whole lotta history
I can't find a way to show what you mean to me
I've fallen all around when you miss me
I don't know what to do so tell me baby

I'm talking 'bout a whole lotta history
I can't find a way to show what you mean to me
I've fallen all around when you miss me
I don't know what to do so tell me baby

[Outro: Sarah (Fade Out)]
And it keeps me spinning
And controls what happens 'til Monday, 'til Monday
And it might sound crazy
But your voice still leaves me all funky, all funky
And it keeps me spinning
And controls what happens 'til Monday, 'til Monday
And it might sound crazy
But your voice still leaves me all funky, all funkyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",pop

I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest, who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder, it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months, I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell Mom this is not her fault
[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

I never conquered, rarely came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I can still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside

The tour is over, I've survived
And I can't wait 'til I get home
To pass the time in my room alone92EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

Tu es mal poli, je t’avais dit de ne pas me tutoyer
Nous n’avons rien gardé ensemble et ne payons pas le même loyer
Tu postillonnes et ton visage est trop près
Ton haleine me saoule, j’ai bien envie de te faire tomber
Ca n’est pas joli, de fixer mon décolleté
Regarde plutôt mes fesses au moins je verrais pas que je me fais mater
Ca ne m’étonne pas que tu sois seul

Les soirées se répètent et
Se ressemblent quoi Si ce n’est pas un mec
C’est deux ou trois Qui te collent comme des
Guêpes sur un pot de Nutella  Quand les bons sont sur le dancefloor
Ceux-là sont pour toi Mais il sent fort, l’alcool sort de ses pores Tu sais que dans une heure tu le
Retrouves devant la porte Avec ses potes en train de la calmer Et tous sont là à faire comme
S’ils étaient armés

Pour leur offrir un verre, faire monter les enchères
Celui qui gagnerait la danse aurait de quoi être fier
Tous les garçons en costard, élégants et polis
Comme ceux qui sont en poster, au dessus de ton lit
Depuis des années, qu’on te fait rêver
La seule chose que tu vois est une brochette de mecs bourrés

1526,Shearwater,You're the Coliseum,relaxed,"They're more prepared to deal with pain perhaps
Than you could be in all your life's long years
The lazy lip of sea, it calmly laps
Beneath the looming disco's tens of tears
Or sure their fondest love is for a fake
An obviously fake contrived ideal
In hotels high above the foaming lake
Above bone plates he'd tie with lamb and veal
And breathing smoke since folded into air
And waving bills since spent on kid's grand schools
Some fat cat calculated it right there
The thing they'd turn so selflessly such tools
The polished plate betrays a vacant host
But they're more prepared to deal with pain than mostEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",folk/acoustic

Living like a heretic
Listening to Arthur Lee records
Making all your friends feel so guilty
About their cynicism
And the rest of their generation
Not even the government are going to stop you now

But are you ready to be heartbroken?
Are you ready to be heartbroken?

Pumped up full of vitamins
On account of all the seriousness
You say you’re so happy now
You can hardly stand
Lean over on the bookcase
If you really want to get straight
Read Norman Mailer
Or get a new tailor

Are you ready to be heartbroken?
Are you ready to be heartbroken?
Are you ready to bleed?

What would it take
What would it take
To wipe that smile off of your face?
Are you ready to be
Are you ready to bleed?

Well you better get ready now baby

1529,Opeth,The Baying of the Hounds,sad,"I hear the baying of the hounds in the distance
I hear them devouring
Pest-ridden jackals of the earth
Diabolical beasts and roaming the forests
In wait and constant protectors
Calling you to sit by his side
Your self-loathing image in his flesh
A revelation upon which you linger

His words are flies swarming towards the true insects
Feasting on buried dreams and spreading decay upon your skin
His eyes spew forth a darkness that cut through and paralyze
Casts light upon your secrets forced to confront your enemies

His mouth is a vortex sucking you into its pandemonium
Fools you with a helping hand of ashes reached out in false dismay
His body is a country, the cities lay dead beyond despair
Friends turned enemies unable to come clean
In a rising fog of reeking death

Everything you believed is a lie
Everyone you loved is a death-burden
So you take comfort in him and you are receptive to stark wishes

No longer struggling to declare your stand
You would inflict no harm to others
They are unaware and in a loop of futile events
You are everything, they are nothing
Drown in the deep mire with past desires
Beneath the mire, drown desire now with you
Drown in the deep mire with past desires
Beneath the mire, drown desire now with you

Lined up verses on dead skin
The tainted lips of a stranger resting upon hers

[Instrumental Break]

And I embrace bereavement
Everything beloved is shattered anyway
I would devote myself to anyone, I would accept any flaws

I am too weak to resist
Tension vibrating with horror, finding the outcast in my eyes
Pushing nerves on a puppet, endless poison in my veins
Clean intent now tainted with death

And so, cold touch now inhumane
Every waking hour awaiting a reverie to unfold
And now they are calling me
Louder by the minute
The baying of the hounds calling me back to my home1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",metal

Oceans are you sorry too
It hurts at times, it haunts the bay

Oh nothing now but ocean ice
The surf brought in the worst surprise
Lone and still the empty bed
The kettle whistles things you said

1532,My Dying Bride,The Light at the End of the World,sad,"An isle, a bright shining isle
Stands forever, alone in the sea
Of rock and of sand and grass
And shale, the isle bereft of trees

- Small. A speck in the wide blue
Sea. 'Tis the last of all the land
A dweller upon our lonesome
Isle, the last, lonely man? -

By the Gods he is there to
Never leave, to remain all his
Life. His punishment for
Evermore, to attend the
Eternal light

The lighthouse, tall and brilliant
White, which stands at the end
Of the world. Protecting ships
And sailors too, from rock they
Could be hurled

Yet nothing comes and nothing
Goes 'sept the bright blue sea
Which stretches near and far
Away, 't is all our man can see
Though, one day, up high on
Rock, a bird did perch and cry
An albatross, he shot a glance
And wondered deeply, why?

Could it be a watcher sent?
A curse sent from the Gods
Who sits and cries and stares at him
The life that they have robbed

Each year it comes to watch
Over him, the creature from above
Not a curse but a reminder of
The woman that he loved

- Oh weary night, under stars
He'd lay and gaze
Up towards the moon and stars
The suns dying haze

Time and again, Orion's light
Filled our man with joy
Within the belt, he'd see his love
Remembering her voice -

The twinkle from the stars above
Bled peace into his heart
As long as she looks down on him
He knows they'll never part
One day good, one day bad
The madness, the heat, the sun
Out to sea, he spies upon land
His beloved Albion

Cliffs of white and trees of green
Children run and play
'My home land' he cries and weeps
Why so far away?

Eyes sore and red. Filled with tears
He runs towards the sea
To risk his life, a worthy cause
For home he would be

Into the sea, deep and blue
The waters wash him clean
Awake. He screams. Cold with sweat
And Albion a dream

- Such is life upon the isle
Of torment and woe
One day good. One day bad
And some days, even hope

The light at the end of the world
Burns bright for mile and mile
Yet tends the man, its golden glow
In misery all the while?
For fifty years he stands and waits
Atop the light, alone
Looking down upon his isle
The Gods have made his home -

The watcher at the end of the world
Through misery does defile
Remembers back to that single night
And allows a tiny smile

(His sacrifice was not so great
He insists upon the world
Again he would crime
Again he would pay
For one moment with the girl)

Her hair, long and black it shone
The dark, beauty of her eyes
Olive skin and warm embrace
Her memory never dies

'Twas years ago, he
Remembers clear
The life they once did live
Endless love and lust for life
They promised each would give

Alas, such love and laughter too
Was short as panting breath
For one dark night, her soul
Was kissed
By the shade of death

(Agony, like none before
Was suffered by our man.)
Who tends the light now
Burning bright
On the very last of land

(Anger raged and misery too
Like nothing ever before.)
He cursed the Gods and man
And life
And at his heart he tore

- A deity felt sympathy
And threw our man a light
'Your woman you may see again
For a single night. -

But think hard and well young man
There is a price to pay:
To tend the light at the end of
The world
Is where you must stay

Away from man and life and love
Alone you will be
On a tiny isle. A bright shining isle
In the middle of the sea.'

- 'I'll tend the light, for one more night
With the woman whom I love'
Screamed the man, with tearful eyes
To the deity above

And so it was that very night
His lover did return
To his arms and to their bed
Together they did turn

In deepest love and lust and passion
Entwined they did fall
Lost within each other's arms
They danced (in lover's ball). -

- Long was the night filled with love
For them the world was done
Awoke he did to brightest light
His woman and life had gone

To his feet he leapt. To the sea he looked
To the lighthouse on the stone
The price is paid and from now on
He lives forever alone

Fifty years have passed since then
And not a soul has he seen
But his woman lives with him still
In every single dream

'Tis sad to hear how young love has died
To know that, alone, someone has cried
But memories are ours to keep
To live them again, in our sleep.-EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",metal

I know what I’ll do today, calculated, not a whim
If my diet never changes, face to face with Grim
But if my family never eatin’ then we live like Tiny Tim
Aren’t you a little too young? Who you to say that?
You doing in the rag, but cannot hide it, no wave cap
I’m on a fuckin’ rampage, but I turn back with a snap
You hear “grrt, grrt,” is that Perry or my gat?
You do not understand the fundamentals
I switch up my flow like the notes on portamentos
We gonna fizz and then we pop just like some Coke and Mentos
Nothing is gonna stop us, because our work is essential
My stash is being shaved and is lowered by the fuckin’ day
Was rolling in the green, but now the numbers in the gray
It’s not an issue, we gon’ go up, up, away

Run it back to Bayville, I was just a kid then
Wish that I could go back, when I knew that I was big dog
Now I'm just a misfit, mistake bottom of the barrel like I been scraping
But that's just the foresight of a hindseer, blinding like some high beams
Sweeter than some syrup, dirty soda make me dry heave
Baby, pass the visine, I need to cry real tears more
But I can't even stomach the pain

Got the rest of y'all feeling like I'm chillin’ on a different tier

1537,Howard Jones,Life In One Day,happy,"The old man said to me
Said don't always take life so seriously
Play the flute
And dance and sing your song

Try and enjoy the here and now
The future will take care of itself somehow
The grass is never greener over there
Time will wear away the stone
Gets the hereditary bone

Chorus
Don't try to live your life in one day
Don't go speed your time away
Don't try to live your life in one day
Don't go speed your time away

The old man said to me
Said you can't change the world single-handedly
Raise a glass enjoy the scenery
Pretend the water is champagne
And fill my glass again and again
While the wolves are gathering round your door
Time will wear away the stone
Gets the hereditary bone
The old man said to me
Said don't always take life so seriously
Play the flute
And dance and sing your song

Try and enjoy the here and now
The future will take care of itself somehow
The grass is never greener over there
Time will wear away the stone
Gets the hereditary bone

I tried to live my life in one day
Don't go speed your time away

I bit off more than I can chew
Only so much you can do

Wolves are gathering round my door
Ask them in and invite some more

I tried to live my life in one day
Don't go speed your time awayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

Out of nowhere
I'm coming apart
Nothing could've saved me
You went straight for my heart

When I've almost had enough
Something about you draws me back again
When I've almost given up
Something about you pulls me in
And we're falling

Feels like
I am reaching
Tryin' to hold on to you
And I know that
There's still hope here
And I know you'll come through

When I've almost had enough
Something about you draws me back again
When I've almost given up
Something about you pulls me in

I don't pick up the mail, I don't pick up the phone
I don't answer the door, I'd just as soon be alone
I don't keep this place up, I just keep the lights down
I don't live in these rooms, I just rattle around

[Chorus]
I'm just a ghost in this house
I'm just a shadow upon these walls
As quietly as a mouse I haunt these halls
I'm just a whisper of smoke
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire
That once burned out of control and took my body and soul
I'm just a ghost in this house

[Verse 2]
I don't mind if it rains, I don't care if it's clear
I don't mind staying in, there's another ghost here
She sits down in your chair and she shines with your light
And she lays down her head on your pillow at night

Chorus:
I'm just a ghost in this house
I'm just a shell of the man I was
A living proof of the damage heartbreak does
I'm just a whisper of smoke
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire
That once burned out of control and took my body and soul
I'm just a ghost in this house
[Chorus]
I'm just a ghost in this house
I'm just a shadow upon these walls

Drag me on your back
For one more day

This is what we're gonna do
Let me put my arms around you once more
There's nothing left here to prove

Walk away just a little bit slower
Better hold on tight, will we ever learn to let it go
Break Through to the other side
I keep wondering
When were you ever gonna let me know
That you just wanted something else in life

What do you say when it's all over
What do you know when nothing's going right
The troubles in your mind
What do you do when you get lost inside your soul
Where do you go when love's gone
What do you say nothing at all

It was so hard when I watched you falling down
But it was time for you to walk alone
Just know if you really need a friend
And you're feeling like you can't go on

Just walk back just a little bit faster
Take my hand I will blow your fears away
Break through to the other side
For bitter or worse I know you better than anyone else
And I'll be by your side
What do you say when it's all over
What do you do when it's all gone
What do you do when you get lost inside your soul
Where do we go when love's gone
What do you say nothing at all

When it all becomes reality
That this is where it ends for you and me
I'm about to lose my mind
Will love find a way on time
Please don't try and kiss these tears away
We know we've both have made mistakes
If I could do it all again
I wouldn't change a single thing

What do you say when it's all over
What do you do when it's all gone
What do you do when you get lost inside your soul
Where do we go when love's gone
What do you say nothing at all

Dirty your face
With longing and grace, God-given
Suffer her heart
And love her when your love goes unrequited

[Verse 1]
Where the cool winds blow
I must surely go
For my love calls me low to drag her from the depths of my soul
When will I see her, again?
The other-side, of friends
The darkened claws, of death
The empty breath, desire

[Chorus]
Dirty your face
With longing and grace, God-given
Suffer her heart
And love her when your love goes unrequited

[Verse 2]
Restless in my speech
And rootless in my teach
So vacant in my breach
I drive the dirt of her garden
Sorrow
She'll never listen, again
No other lovers, to bend
Just rotten apples, to eat
Just lettered, yellowed distant scorn

Dirty your face
With longing and grace, God-given
Suffer her heart
And love her when your love goes unrequited

The horizon has been defeated
By the pirates of the new age
Alien casinos
Well, maybe it's just time to say
Things can go bad
And make you want to run away
But as we grow older
The troubles just seems to stay

[Verse 1]
Future complications
In the strings between the cans
But no prints can come from fingers
If machines become our hands
And then our feet become the wheels
And then the wheels become the cars
And then the rigs begin to drill
Until the drilling goes too far

[Chorus 2]
Things can go bad
And make you want to run away
But as we grow older
The horizon begins to fade away
[Verse 2]
Thingama jigsaw puzzled
Anger, don't you step too close
Because people are lonely and only
Animals with fancy shoes
Hallelujah zig-zag nothing
Misery it's on the loose
Because people are lonely and only
Animals with too many tools
That can build all the junk that we sell
Sometimes it makes you want to yell

Things can go bad
And make you want to run away
But as we grow older
The horizon begins to fade away

In a river the color of lead
Immerse the baby's head
Wrap her up in the News Of The World
Dump her on a doorstep, girl
This night has opened my eyes
And I will never sleep again
You kicked and cried like a bullied child
A grown man of twenty-five
Oh, he said he'd cure your ills
But he didn't and he never will

[Chorus 1]
Oh, save your life
Because you've only got one
The dream has gone
But the baby is real
Oh, you did a good thing
She could have been a poet
Or, she could have been a fool
Oh, you did a bad thing
And I'm not happy
And I'm not sad

A shoeless child on a swing
Reminds you of your own again
She took away your troubles
Oh, but then again
She left pain

Oh, please save your life
Because you've only got one
The dream has gone

On a night that could never surprise me

You're going nowhere and you're going there fast

All the other simple moves I could've made
All the other cards that I could've dealt
All the books I didn't read upon my shelf
All the other ways I could've sung my songs
I've realized that none of it went wrong
It was all play, how could it be any other way?

Said you need to do it, 'cause you can't feel it tonight
Well you can if you want to
Want to take you outside, want to show you the sky
To remind you why you shouldn't

[Chorus 1]
Do your worst if you can
Do your worst if you can, do it
You can if you want
You can take it - yeah, you want to run
Said you wanted to, then kissed the gun
You can if you want to
And you want to do it, and you want to do it
If you want to do it, you are going to do it
Even if I don't want you to

Hide it from me, if you must
Hide it from me, if you don't trust anything I say right to you

And you want to do it, if you want to do it
You will if you want to
And you want to do it, if you want to do it

And you want to do it, and you want to do it
If you want to do it, you are going to do it
Even if I don't want you to

I was inside painting your name on the window
I was somewhere inside
And I wanted to find out why you're hiding
I was tired of the fight

[Chorus 3]
Look me in the eyes, say you can't do it
Look me in the eyes, say you can't do it
But you will if you want to
Look me in the eyes, say you can't do it
Look me in the eyes, say you can't do it
But you will if you want to
And you want to do it, and you want to do it
If you want to do it, you are going to do it
Even if I don't want you to

And don't smile at me and tell me things will work out for me too

Taste your vanity and its sweet bitterness
As you hide behind your veil of
My stolen hopes and lost dreams

You took them all

As you build your dreams
On my shattered hopes
I'll look back on
A day once loved
And fantasize for
Tragedy

Swallow your pity

Beg me to make this easier
And listen to my hopeless cries
Suffer alone
In emptiness

I lust to
See you swallowed by
The mess that
You left in your wake

Disgust lies deep within
Your empty (gaze)

Beg me to make this easier

Send stares into

My
Envy can't describe how I loathe you
For having all the stars
Leaving my eyes to marvel the sky
Knowing it should be mine
Yet it's you I see wasting the dream
That only I deserve

And I served on the Danville train
'Till Stoneman's cavalry came
And tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65
We were hungry, just barely alive
By May the 10th, Richmond had fell
It's a time I remember, oh so well
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went, ""Na, na, la, na, na, la""
Back with my wife in Tennessee
When one day she called to me
""Virgil, quick, come see
There goes Robert E. Lee!""
Now, I don't mind chopping wood
And I don't care if the money's no good
You take what you need
And you leave the rest
But they should never
Have taken the very best
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singing
They went, ""Na, na, la, na, na, la""
Like my father before me
I will work the land
And like my brother above me
Who took a rebel stand
He was just 18, proud and brave
But a Yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the mud below my feet
You can't raise a Kane back up
When he's in defeat
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singing
They went, ""Na, na, la, na, na, la""

All that I see is that we're livin' life
Did you fall when you found that you paid the price
Hope it wasn't lost in an honest truth
So the past doesn't break all that we've been through
Every little thing that you did was right
But who knows what you did on the day you cried endlessly
Oh, you cried endlessly

1579,Hawk Nelson,Everything You Ever Wanted,sad,"I walked the line
Leave it all behind
I've been waiting forever
Lets go back in time
When I could read your mind
So long I've been waiting

It took the seasons going by
To know its not my fault

I tried to be perfect, tried to be honest
Tried to be everything that you ever wanted
I tried to be stronger, tried to be smarter
Tried to be everything but you

Its been so long
Since youve been home
I used to wait up forever
I used to say a prayer
Wishing you were there
And im still waiting

You told me once
You'd show up
But i fell for that
Before I fell to pieces
Then I woke up
To no one
Just a picture of Jesus
And a house left in pieces
It took the seasons going by
To know its not my fault

I tried to be perfect, tried to be honest
Tried to be everything that you ever wanted
I tried to be stronger, tried to be smarter
Tried to be everything but you

I wanted you
I need you
I want to believe you [x2]

You crossed your heart you'd quit

Your promise for my ring
Now just like back to grade school
You're doing the same old thing

Stop! The love you save may be your own

Or some day you'll be all alone

They'll ruin your reputation
They'll label you a flirt

Beneath the apple tree
When Benjie held your hand he felt

He said he rang your chimes

1581,My Dying Bride,Into the Lake of Ghosts,sad,"Enter the Ghost Lake
The waters whisper
Of something brooding
No way out of here

Slow smouldering
Slow rain(ing) heat
Lapping at your skin
Pulling you down again

I wish that I could
Fan back to life
The dying embers
Of my long lost passion

Descending deeper
With black as my light
With twist and turn
All men will be tried in life

We look for light to call
The call to save us all
Lest we fall to our knees
The death, we kiss his feet
Oh, sacred mother come
For our fate is done
In blindness do we run
Always backwards
The care of many
Was lost in my hands
The sickness came in
Floods of torment and woe

My withered body
Aching and bone tired
My christ who art lord
Hold me down again

Knee bent and head held low
Eyes closed against my foe
In prayer I sing on low
Answers to my last call
Oh, sacred father come
For it is you who's done
In blindness you will run
And be sure not to fall

Oh, christ, what have I done?
Ill fortune now will come
Fire raining from the sun
All virtue swept away
In floods of blackest death
The ghost will take my breath
My sins I will forget
I am nothing again
Exit the Ghost Lake
The waters silent
What now has risen?
No man stands alone

The world is changing
'Tis misery who
Leads our way now
Holding man down and again

Knee bent and head held low
Eyes closed against my foe
In prayer I sing on low
Answers to my last call
Oh, sacred father come
For it is you who's done
In blindness you will run
And be sure not to fall

Oh, christ, what have I done?
Ill fortune now will come
Fire raining from the sun
All virtue swept away
In floods of blackest death
The ghost will take my breath
My sins I will forget

I need some for the nighttime

When the Sun go down, we still shine and vine
Still shine and vine, for the 9-1-9

That's how we, that's how we do that shit

Aiyo, it's the new flavor, the next step
Phonte, the best kept secret since the A.I.D.S. cure
I stay raw whether they bootleg it or pay for it
Old school like Prince Dejour when he was hostin Rap City with fingerwaves on
I put my name on the map through dismantling
Embarrassing arrogant cats and battle 'em because they raps ain't astonishing
Got niggas in the club spitting out they Heinekens
Like, ""Goddammit, when that nigga Tay gon' rhyme again?""
He's nice with the homonyms, ill flow
I guess I got it from my mom and them, for real doe
Who does it finer? This one is for the MCs in Carolina
Three in the morning, insomnia rhymers
That say, ""Yo, let's put the drama behind us, just let the beats rock""
Started cypher while the wack niggas eavesdrop
9th mouse clicked it on the b-box
9th always hit me on my sweet spot
Go to the crib, drink some Peach Schnapps
And doze off to Pete Rock, what
[Chorus: Phonte]
For the 9-1-9, for the 9-1-9
When the Sun go down, we still shine and vine
Still shine and vine, for the 9-1-9
And the 9-1-9, and the 3-3-6
When the nighttime come, that's how we do that shit
That's how we, that's how we do that shit
Aiyo this is for the 9-1-9, for the 9-1-9
When the sun go down, we still shine and vine
Still shine and vine, for the 9-1-9
And the 9-1-9, and the 3-3-6
When the nighttime come, that's how we do that shit
That's how we, that's how we do that shit

I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier (la-de-dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah)
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Yo...

[Verse 1]
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect
If it meant life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see if it's true
If it's you—what you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel it's part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real?
In confrontation, ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it; if you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable'll leave you full of bullets, pull it
Squeeze it 'til it's empty; tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier)
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier)
Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier)
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier)
Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

I love pissin' you off, gets me off
Like my lawyers when the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do, bitch, it's news
Pistol-whippin' motherfucking bouncers 6'2""
Who needs bullets? As soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops
Runnin' and duckin' out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot, whether it's your fault or not, 'cause I'm a—

They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up

I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin' to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two-inch
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And Lord, have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities, in the face of adversity, I'm a—

My model, like Ben Cartwright to Hoss

And though he pays me minimum wage
It's all I deserve at this stage
Some union hack said I should ask for more
I answered with suitable rage

I love my boss
I love my boss
I love my boss

One day I came to work too late
I'd had a Früvous luncheon date
My boss he summoned me to speak with him
I sweated, awaiting my fate
He said ""you're done!""
He chased me two blocks with a gun
But my dear boss let me apologize
In hindsite, there wasn't a gun

He's going out now with my sister
They go real heavy on the sauce
I'd like to tell him watch out mister
But he's the boss
My friends they say that I am clinging
Ask why I'm carrying this cross
Who knows what club-med will be bringing
From dear old boss

With the help of Perry White
And if we may be retrograde
Speak the name Reuben Kincaid

The truth is that I'm longing

She'll be there time after time

Someone put your hand out

Save me now from the path I'm on

Dwellin' on the past, (Past!) it's burnin' on my brain (Hot!)
Everyone that burns has to learn from the pain
Hey, I think about the day (Days!)
My girlie ran away with my pay when fellas came to (Play!) play
Now, she's stuck with my homies that she fucked (Ooh!)
And I'm just a sucker with a lump in my throat, hey

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Like a chump
(Hey!) I'm like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) I'm like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!)

[Verse 2]
Should I be feelin' bad? (No!) Should I be feelin' good? (No!)
It's kinda sad, I'm the laughin' stock of the neighborhood
And you would think that I'd be movin' on (Move it!)
But I'm a sucker, like I said, fucked up in the head, not!
And maybe, she just made a mistake
And I should give her a break, my heart'll ache either way
Hey, what the hell, what you want me to say?
I won't lie, that I can't deny
[Chorus]
I did it all for the nookie (Come on!)
The nookie (Come on!)
So you can take that cookie

[Verse 3]
Why did it take so long?
Why, did I wait so long, huh?
To figure it out, but I did it
And I'm the only one underneath the sun who didn't get it
I can't believe that I could be deceived (But you were!)
By my so-called girl, but in reality
Had a hidden agenda
She put my tender heart in a blender, and still, I surrendered
[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) I'm like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump

It's so easy for your friends to give you their advice
They'll tell you, ""Just let it go!""
It's easier said than done
I appreciate it, I do, but
Just leave me alone, leave me alone
Just leave me alone

I'm just gonna stay here and always be the same
And nothing gonna change, so you can go away

1596,Copeland,The Grey Man,relaxed,"Don't worry now it's all erased, burned to grey and white. Your fireproof heart was never wasted, and steady all the while...So you say

Dont' worry now it's all come back. Colorless as night. You'll be there, you'll see her face. And hear her all the while

By the time you find your way, you're gonna run right back to the start. Don't think you're lost. You're gonna run right back to the start. And when you finally think it's gone, you're gonna run right back to her arms

Don't worry now it's all erased, burned to grey and white. Tell yourself you don't still taste her. Or hear her through the night

Run, run fast enough to lose yourself. Our legs were straight but only move in circles

By the time you find your way, you're gonna run right back to the start. Don't think you're lost. You're gonna run right back to the start. And when you finally think it's gone, you're gonna run right back to the start. You're gonna run right back to her armsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",folk/acoustic
1597,Donald Fagen,Mary Shut The Garden Door,relaxed,"They came in under the radar
When our backs were turned around
In a fleet of Lincoln Town Cars
They rolled into our town
Confounded all six senses
Like an opiate in the brain
Mary shut the garden door
Looks a lot like rain

Mary shut the garden door
Mary shut the garden door

We pounded Rachel's radio
For reports about the bridge
There was nothing on but static
Nothing in the fridge
We lay there listening to the wind
Whistling through the pines
When we heard the engines idling
Saw the headlights through the blinds

Mary shut the garden door
Mary shut the garden door

Rough dreams
Those voices in the kitchen
I woke up
And sensed the new condition
They won
Storms raged
Things changed
Forever
So if you ever see an automaton
In a midprice luxury car
Better roll the sidewalks up
Switch on your lucky star
'Cause this zombie does impressions
But not really to amuse
This ballad is for lovers
With something left to lose

1598,Lisa Hannigan,Pistachio,relaxed,"Sit down and fire away
I know it's tricky when you're feeling low
When you feel like your flavour has gone the way
Of a pre-shelled pistachio
I know you're weighed down
And fed up with your heavy boots
Laced with melancholy notions all your own

I do — like sugar — tend toward the brittle and sticky when spun
And I know my demeanour can go the way
Of a photo left out in the sun
And I try to keep myself in lilies and flax seeds
Oh what a folly, fooling just yourself

Sit down and smoke away
I wouldn't knock it till you're in them shoes
I watch as our subtlety blows away
As a blush it gives way to a bruise
But seemly we'd freely make the trade off
A dry rot to take the weight off
And swap the boots for red shoes1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",folk/acoustic
1599,Cars Can Be Blue,Dirty Song,happy,"I've begun to question the ways you count your love
We've been holding hands now for quite long enough
Just so happens that the way to this heart of mine
Might seem a bit unusual so I'll lay it on the line

You can sodomize me
Get behind and ride me
Stuff your cock inside me
Proceed to fuck me blindly

You might think I'm dirty if I let you have your way
That's the way that boys and girls have been raised to play
If you can't control yourself in saying something more
I can think of things to do with that mouth of yours

You can eat me out
With that dirty mouth
Throw me on the couch
Do it then get out...

We don't have to do anything if you don't want
We can just look into eachother's eyes
And masturbate

Two three four!
Promise not to take from you without me giving back
Love is love is love is love but this just isn't that
Take a shower when we're done but this won't wash away
If you keep me satisfied I might let you stay

I will suck you off
Choke me with your cock
Blow it on my face
Your load I want to taste...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock
1600,Grace Jones,I'm Crying (Mother's Tears),sad,"Bathed in the water she ran every morning
Smacked in the bed she turned down every night
I'm strong in food she prepared for me
Now I'm all grown up
Heating my hands on the very cold days
Drenched in the rain almost every school game
And in the middle of a scare, she's there
To wake me up

I'm strong enough, I'm tough enough
I'm full enough, I'm crying my mother's tears
I'm warm enough, I've played enough
Loved enough, I'm crying my mother's tears

Treating my cuts with her own remedies
Combing my hair while she covered my knees
And sent me books I was forbidden to read
Educating me

I was there by her side when my grandmother died
Her weakness is strength, she's unable to cry
And lover's tears fell from father's eyes
She was all cried out

I'm strong enough, I'm tough enough
Slept enough, I'm crying my mother's tears
I'm well enough, I've read enough
I've loved enough, I'm crying my mother's tears
Cause I'm doing my best
To keep her living the rest

I'm trying (you cry every night until dawn)
To stay awake (don't make me regret you were born)
I'm falling in (your faces are covered in red)
I'm having public display (and your mother don't have the last word)
Crashing (I'm coming from the rain)
To the thunder (and don't let me hear you complain)
Scattering myself (tell me nothing's real)
Over the floor (you can feel my pain)

Little memories of our past
Reminds her of how I used to make her mad
I'm crying, I'm crying

I'm strong enough, I'm tough enough
Full enough, I'm crying my mother's tears
She shed enough, she's pled enough
Well enough, I'm crying my mother's tears

I'm strong enough, I'm tough enough

Go ahead and wager that you never listen to another song of mine
I can't say I blame you either
Cause if you made records you ain't gonna catch me listening to that shit
But if you do I just want you to know, I didn't make this to hurt you
God knows, you done hurt enough
Just... I don't know, try to make some real shit, you know

[Verse 1]
Bye, you ain't never gonna see me again
If I can help it, little fellow take it easy
Fresh out of forced tears, kisses and hugs
You about to lose the company your misery loves
Ain't never did nothing but try to kill your disease
At least help the symptoms, instead you infected me
I'm not the kind of man to draw a line in the sand
If you gotta draw at all then it's time for you to scram
P.S., you can keep all this shit
And hang around your broke friends and call yourself rich
The struggling I did with you was all for nothin'
It was never enough, your heart set on suffering
I admit that I was weak in the beginnin'
I wanted someone to need me instead of a friendship
I didn't think I deserved a true partner
So I transferred the arrangement I had with my mama
[Bridge]
Since you never listen to a word I ever said
Maybe seeing this door slam, will get it through your head
I don't love you, I don't think I ever did
And if you hadn't tried to kill me, I'd stayed for the kid

[Hook] X 2
There's nothin'more for us to say
Got my mind made up, I'm walking away
Sometimes we just outgrow the role that we play
Hope you find a happy ending to you story someday

[Verse 2]
Round and round and round we used to go
I never fucked you right or made enough bread, I know
If I'm such a bastard, and mistreated you so
Then how is it you're losing your mind to see me go?
Truth be told, I held you together
For all them years, and I cheated on you never
Defended your honor, took in your mama
When she tried to rehab and had you back through the drama
You got a sick stone under your ribs
Where a heart is suppose to live
Sick, twisted and vindictive, with your windows dim
Baby, you're not wicked hard bull fish, you must shiver
How you threaten to kill the most precious
Gift that you'll ever be blessed with?
Unless you're twisted, demented and depressed and shit
And alone cause you faithfully slayed your friendships

Laughing at himself because he knows he isn't loved at all

It makes him feel like a man
Because he's loving all the ladies

To say he needs a decent girl

And the next thing you know man

Oh man, she laughs so loud
And if it isn't this, then its that

I suppose you were just stating your views
What was it all for?
For the weather or the battle of Agincourt

And the times that we all hoped would last
Like a train they have gone by so fast
And though we stood together
By the edge of the platform
We were not moved by them

With my own hands
When I make love to your memory
It's not the same
I miss the thunder
I miss the rain

And the fact that you don't understand
Casts a shadow over this land
But the sun still shines
From behind it

Thanks all the same
But I cannot bring myself to answer your letter
It's not your fault
But your honesty touches me like a fire

I dreamed you were a cosmonaut
Of the space between our chairs
And I was a cartographer
Of the tangles in your hair

[Verse 2]
I sang the song that silence brings
It's the one that everybody knows, oh everybody knows
The song that's silencing
And this, this is how it goes

[Verse 3]
These looms that weave apocrypha
They're hanging from a strand
These dark and empty rooms were full
Of incandescent hands

[Bridge]
Awkward pause, the fatal flaw
Time, it's a crooked bow
Time is a crooked bow
Time you need to learn to love
The ebb just like the flow

[Verse 4]
Grab hold of your bootstraps and pull like hell
Until gravity feels sorry for you and lets you go
As if you lack the proper chemicals to know, oh
The way it felt the last time you let yourself fall this low
[Bridge]
Time, time it's a crooked bow
Time's a crooked bow
Time's a crooked bow, oh, ooh

[Verse 5]
Fifty-five and three-eighths years later
At the bottom of this gigantic crater
An armchair calls to you
Yeah, this armchair calls to you

[Verse 6]
And it says that someday we'll get back at them all
With epoxy and a pair of pliers
As ancient sea slugs begin to crawl
Through the ragweed and barbed wire, oh

[Outro]
You didn't write, you didn't call
It didn't cross your mind at all, hey
Through the waves, the waves of A.M. squall

Like a child at the wheel of a rocket
He comes round here with a license to love
But i don't know where he got it
I trusted you offered everything
But i'm not sure you deserve it

You tell me that i'm lucky
But i feel like giving up
'cause a heart like mine's wasted on you
If you don't know what you've got

You throw it away
Throw it away
All the heart and the soul i've been giving
You throw it away
Throw it away
Like it's no big deal you'll be missin'
You throw it away
Throw it away
Run it underground

Fly by frankie's got it in his head
That he's something i know that he's not
He's like a blind bull in a china shop
When it comes to affairs of the heart
You wouldn't know what love is
If it hit you like a rock
And a girl like me is lost on you
If you don't know what you've got

Chorus

Every breath in the park
Every dance in the dark
Every promise you make
You go and throw it away
Every smile in the rain
You know it's always the same
You go and do it again

If it hit you like a rock
And a girl like me is lost on you

We move like cagey tigers
We couldn't get closer than this
The way we walk, the way we talk
The way we stalk, the way we kiss

We slip through the streets while everyone sleeps
Getting bigger and sleeker, and wider and brighter
We bite and scratch and scream all night
Let's go and throw all the songs we know

[Chorus]
Into the sea, you and me
All the years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring, it's a treacherous thing
We missed you hissed the lovecats
We missed you hissed the lovecats

We're so wonderfully, wonderfully
Wonderfully, wonderfully pretty
Oh, you know that I'd do anything for you
We should have each other to tea, huh?
We should have each other with cream?

Then curl up in the fire
And sleep for awhile
It's the grooviest thing
It's the perfect dream
Into the sea, you and me
All the years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring, it's a treacherous thing
We missed you hissed the lovecats
We missed you hissed the lovecats

We're so wonderfully, wonderfully
Wonderfully, wonderfully pretty
Oh, you know that I'd do anything for you

Get up for awhile

And always the right way round

And I'm dying in this summer heat
I hope like hell you're waiting, waiting

Everybody's living like they're crazy in love
I'm a dizzy mess and everything is so above me
From the floor I found the life I lead today

[Chorus]
Well, they can take, take, take the kids from the summer
But they'll never, never, never take the summer from me
It was the very first time that I lost my mind for the week
They can't make, make, make me forget the weather
If I never, never, never wash the sand from my feet
It was the very last time, then we said goodbye to the beach
We're showing off, we're showing off our teeth

So make one last call back home
'Cause tonight we go it alone
And I hope that you know I'm waiting, waiting

Just give me something (Tell me do you feel me, listen can you hear it?)
Stop pretending (Cave in and believe me, open up and scream it)

Sifting through crackling vinyl
Lost memories of my youth
Are coming into view

Between lost hills divide
Quietly we sleep inside
Lost summers of my youth
I spent them all with you

Take ways by withered creeks
Lizards sunning in the streets
Small kitten stretches through
Green empty yards you knew

Weekend in san geronimo
Love how the starlit skies show
Weekend in san geronimo
Sentiment within me glows

Somewhere up fifteen miles
Barefoot on kitchen tile
Where nights are warm and true
I'll spend them all with you

Before the street fights, the fire
Free in the world that you've given
Lay in the sound, the water still calls

Hide in the dirt of the ground
Free in the wind that surrounds me
I'm not afraid to sleep in the night

To sleep in the night

Free like a bird of the holders
Holding the wake of the sun
I know the road that you send me
I know the way it leads to home

Real like the flesh that covers the grave
It's real like the flesh
That covers the grave

Before I'll show myself
Wait for the storm that comes to me
Maybe I'll just change my mind

You wanna fly? You wanna fall?""
So I shout, ""Oh, I wanna get away from you
As fast as I can""

Something I have to say
Love you too much to leave

But I guess it's a test
In the quest for happiness
And the rest of that mess
So I best just acquiesce
Even though I've grown tired of you

And that ain't meant to sound spiteful
I just try to be insightful
When I write all my emotions
In the night all the stuff I try to fight
Will just come out and the sad fact is I'm so tired of you

Love, it's a weird thing ain't it?
There's no way to explain it
But I swear as well as pain
There should be joy but we sustain
The same level of mundane
And it's numbing me through
I often wonder if I'd miss you
And have the urge to kiss you
If an issue was to hit through
To this heart that now feels disused
And said issue was too big to just ignore
And I walked out on you

The chances are I'd fall apart
And suffer seizures of the heart
As my chest begins to smart
The very second have to part
I want to go back to the start
But then again maybe I just feel new
Maybe I'd get my life on track
And start to focus my attack
On all the things my life just lacks
And start to claw my passion back
Instead of living like a hack
Half committed half relaxed
I'd have nothing to lose

Chorus (x2)

I guess lately I've had too much time to think
And yeah way too much drink
When paper meets the ink
Over-thinking is the chink in my armour
That's just what I do
And I've always been that way
Forever questioning each day
And every plea that's made
That maybe when I lay
My busy mind will make me prove
By finding problems and reasons
That might not even be true
See we got together so young
Before our real lives had begun
But flowers don't grow up as one
Each finds its own route to the sun
And that's exactly what we've done
We've grown up separately too
And for a few years now it's been the problem
And these realisations, I wish that I could stop them
But I've realised that love is all we have in common
And deep down you know that's true

But then surely that I'm still in love with you
Means there's something we can do
To get us through and to pursue
A brand new point of view
On how this gap grew, between me and you

So there's a weight over me and I'd hate to have to leave
But in fate I don't believe and the state of you and me
Isn't great as you can see
So I'll keep thinking this through

This is the final boarding call for flight 1259 departing from Los Angeles. Final destination to St. Louis. Thank you

[Verse 1]
Damn G, the spot's gettin hot
So how the fuck am I supposed to make a knot?
Police looking at niggas through a microscope
In L.A. everybody and they momma sell dope
They trying to stop it
So what the fuck can I do to make a profit?
Catch a flight to St. Louis
That's cool, 'cause nobody knew us
We stepped off the plane
Four gang bangers, professional crack slangers
Rented a car at wholesale
Drove to the ghetto, and checked in a motel
Unpacked and I grab the three-eighty
'Cause where we stayin', niggas look shady
But they can't fade South Central
Cause bustin a cap is fundamental
Peepin' out every block close
Seein which one will clock the most
Yeah this is the one no doubt
Bust a U, Bone, and let's clear these niggas out
Ay ay man, whassup nigga?
Yo, well this Lench Mob nigga!
*gunshots*
[Verse 2]
Now clearin' em out meant casualties
Still had the L.A. mentality
Bust a cap, and out of there in a hurry
Wouldn't you know, a drive-by in Missouri
Them fools got popped
Took they corner next day, set up shop
And it's better than slangin' in the Valley
Triple the profit makin' more than I did in Cali
Breakin' off rocks like Barney Rubble
Cause them mark-ass niggas don't want trouble
And we ain't on edge when we do work
Police don't recognize the khakis and the sweatshirts
Getting bitches and they can't stand a
Nineteen-ninety-one Tony Montana
Now the shit's like a war
Of gang violence, where it was never seen before
Punks run when the gat bust
Four Jheri curl niggas kickin' up dust
And some of them are even lookin' up to us
Wearing our colors and talkin' that gang fuss
Giving up much love
Dyin' for a street, that they never heard of
But other motherfuckers want to stand strong
So you know the phrase, once again it's on
[TV announcer]
Top of the news tonight, gangs from South Central, Los Angeles which are known for their drive-by shootings have migrated into East St. Louis, leaving three dead and two others injured. No arrests have been made. Police say this is a nationwide trend, with similar incidents occurring in Texas, Michigan, and Oklahoma
(""If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere!"")

[Verse 3]
(Boom) My homie got shot he's a goner, black
St. Louis niggas want they corner back
Shooting in snowy weather
It's illegal business, niggas still can't stick together
Fuckin' police got the 4-1-1
That L.A. ain't all, surf and sun
But we ain't thinkin' 'bout the boys
Feudin', like the Hatfields and McCoys
Now the shit's gettin' tricky
Cause now they lookin' for the colors and the Dickies
Damn, the spot's gettin' hot from the battle
About to pack up and start slangin' in Seattle
But the NARCs, raid about six in the mornin'
Try to catch a nigga when he's yawnin'
Put his Glock to my chest as I pause
Went to jail in my motherfuckin' drawers
Tryin' to give me, fifty-seven years
Face'll be full of those tattooed tears
It's the same old story and the same old nigga stuck
And the public defender ain't givin' a fuck
The fool must be sparkin'
Talkin' about a double life plea bargain
You got to deal with the Crips and the Bloods by hand, G
Plus the Black Guerilla family
And the white pride don't like no side
And it's a riot if anyone of us die
No parole or probation
Now this is a young man's summer vacation
No chance for rehabilitation
Cause look at the motherfuckin' years that I'm facin'
I'ma end it like this cause you know what's up
My life is fucked
[Man and (Police)]:
Police, eat a dick straight up
(Look here you goddamn nigga, you're not gafflin' nobody
You fuckin' understand me? [Kick his ass, put him down]
That's right, get down on the goddamn ground NOWWWW! Fuckin move, NOWWW! [Let me take a shot at him])

Haunting me tonight
With hope's last breath
I take this moment in
It will be the last
When morning breaks and sunlight takes the pain away

[Chorus]
Ever after never came, and I'm still waiting
For a life that never was
And all the dreams that I laid to rest
Are ghosts that keep me
After all that I've become
I am only one
I am only one

I close my eyes
And bleed this empty heart
Of all that longs to die
When faces lie and love will falter
I'm left with only time
And time will break the dreams that take the pain away

Ever after never came, and I'm still waiting
For a love I'll never have
And all the dreams that I laid to rest
Are ghosts that keep me
After all that I've become
I am only one
I am only one
I'm on my own here and
No one's left to be the hero
This fairy tale got wrong
As night will fall
My heart will die alone

Ever after never came, and I'm still waiting
For my heart to beat again
And all the dreams that I laid to rest
Are ghosts that keep me

1642,The Cat Empire,The Rhythm,happy,"And for all of the sweet loving
That I have received
In the sun in the rain
By the moon by the sea
There is one time that I'm thinking of
One time where one woman
Did knock me off my feet
And my knees were shaking
And my jaw was dropping
And my eyes were squinting
And my smile was growing
And my pants were bulging
And my hands were sweating
And my chest was beating
So I cry
""Excuse me, what is the secret to your soul?""

Cause when you're walking along
When you're walking along

Your legs are a melody my hands
Would like to play
And your hips are a note
That does take me away
And your face and your eyes and your hair
And your waist and your smile
Drive me to distraction
She turned and she gave the evil eye
""Why thank you,"" she said
Then she sighed, ""Oh there's one thing
I think you failed to mention""
""What?"" I said then she said
""It's the rhythm you forgot""
And right then I knew what was what
And she snuck to my lips
And she kissed them
She said ""Young man
I'll show you some rhythm""
Oh and she'll show you some rhythm

And since then
The rhythm's been running through my veins
In my thoughts in my eyes
In my head
It's insane
It's the thing that does drive me to scream
On the street when I think
Of some places it's taken me
I feel horny
When I'm thinking of some of that rhythm in my mind
What she gave, what she gives to me
All of the time
Say a little bit of sweet
Loving in your day
All my friends know it
Keeps the bad thoughts away
So sing with your hips my baby
When you're dancing to this tune
And when this tune is through
We'll sneak to some place and continue to
Say sing with your hips my baby
When you're dancing to this tune
And when this tune is through
We'll sneak to some place and continue to

Tell me it's over, Rusbel awaits
I've been to the surface and nothing is there
Eyelids sank muffled in the nerve aura sound
But when she awakes, will she still be with us?
My heart is darkclots, leap year is late
How did you get here? Ask all but the bait
From a Christ that went hissing, constricting his cells
We summon by candle, by book and by bell

Glossolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence
Stuffed the voice inside of God
Mirrors to the animals
Glossolalia coats my skin

The sermon goes mourning pricking its hail
Slothful the child that preys on the seed
Shall behead the drought, wound under sleeves
I hope you have room in a thicket of vines
Give me a moment to claim what you've stole
The streets will hang high stretched ribs and let taste
We'll cover the smell with silver nitrate
Mending the cuts of your prosthetic faith

Stuffed the voice inside of God
Mirrors to the animals
Glossolalia coats my skin

Then so long, dear mnemonic
Assume the form you've given me and I'll spill
Now hold on, just hold my hand
Say that they made you, but you brought your own leash
Tell me no more, no
Tell me no more, no

Outside by the drift
You read my will of thread and itch
Failure to comply as failure to decease
And still you won't know everything
I've built the fall

[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 5]
The sulking drained the fall of my pale will swarming by your steps
Licking the ankles of your blasphemer guilts
It only meant to drape a plastic over the stuck pig scalp of head
To cover the sock where the flatline had spread
The kiosk in my temporal lobe is shaped like Rosalyn Carter
She says my map is home again but torn face down
I have only but a million blemishes to tell you all about

[Refrain]
In the end they just gagged me to make him come out

[Verse 6]
Gas me the hind of your five legged snare
Tooth picks the eye, but nothing's there
Down drags your waltz 'cross the altar top
From a sleep that deprivation knew
Trespass your form, I'm void of dusk
I'd ask to look, but the mask stays on
You'll levitate teutonic print
Cruelty is the wrath of my instrument

[Refrain]
In the end they just gagged me to make him come out

[Verse 7]
You locked the cuffs, arsenic erupts
Will you drink the shadow of my red hair?
You and your false witness to God
You've one in the chamber, but your finger got stuck
Let slip the sound of a cry for help
But all was lost on the night you walked
Palms speak through eyes, serve your memory lost
I contaminate with insignias
[Refrain]
In the end they just gagged me to make him come out

[Chorus]
Glossolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence
Stuffed the voice inside of God
Mirrors to the animals

[Bridge]
Wait 'til I get my hands on you
I won't forget a face that lift me
Just you wait 'til I get my hands on you
I can't, oh, oh, oh
You won't remember

[Verse 8]
Unwrap my corpse and let it thaw
In the eye of the needle I can't get out
They'll check my wrist, I'll faint a pulse
I'm not the human you thought I was
If you pet the night, sixth pentacle dice
If you roll the seven, St. Michael dies
They'll be no ransom, don't shut my mouth

1646,John Denver,Grandma's Feather Bed,happy,"When I was a little bitty boy
Just up off the floor
We used to go down to grandma's house
Ev'ry month end or so
We'd have chicken pie and country ham
And homemade butter on the bread
But the best darn thing about Grandma's house
Was a great big feather bed

It was nine feet high and six feet wide
Soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick
It'd hold eight kids 'n' four hound dogs
And a piggy we stole from the shed
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
On grandma's feather bed

After supper we'd sit around the fire
The old folks'd spit and chew
Pa would talk about the farm and the war
And granny'd sing a ballad or two
I'd sit and listen and watch the fire
'Till the cobwebs filled my head
Next thing I'd know I'd wake up in the morning
In the middle of the old feather bed
It was nine feet high and six feet wide
Soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick
It'd hold eight kids 'n' four hound dogs
And a piggy we stole from the shed
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
On grandma's feather bed

Well I love my ma, I love my pa
I love granny and grandpa too
I've been fishin' with my uncle, I wrestled with my cousin
I even kissed Aunt Lou, eww!
But if I ever had to make a choice
I guess it ought to be said
That I'd trade 'em all plus the gal down the road

And with the local DBC news
LL Cool J with a triumphant comeback
Word (But tonight—)

Don't call it a comeback, I been here for years
I'm rocking my peers, putting suckas in fear
Making the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosions, overpowering
Over the competition, I'm towering
Wrecking shop when I drop
These lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare, you better move
Don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's paying the price

Don't you call this a regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty-bitty world by storm
And I'm just getting warm
Just like Muhammad Ali, they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
That you know I had beef with
Why do you riff with me? The maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready 'cause it might go blaow
How ya like me now?
The Ripper will not allow
You to get with, Mr. Smith, don't riff
Listen to my gear shift
I'm blasting, outlasting
Kinda like Shaft, so you could say I'm shafting
Olde English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme

When I rip and kill at will
The man of the hour, tower of power
I'll devour
I'm gonna tie you up and let you
Understand that I'm not your average man

Ooh, listen to the way I slay
Your crew
Damage, uh, damage, uh
Damage, uh, damage
Destruction, terror, and mayhem
Pass me a sissy-soft sucka, I'll slay him
Farmers (What?) Farmers (What?)
I'm ready (We ready)
I think I'm gonna bomb a town (Get down)
Don't you never, ever, pull my lever
'Cause I explode
And my nine is easy to load
I gotta thank God
'Cause he gave me the strength to rock hard

Our love is rock steady

[Verse 1]
Love is like a punishment
Homegirl here to represent
So innocently you seem to come my way
While Tinkerbell and Cupid play
They sit there and they laugh
I sit here and I can’t believe my eyes
You found me at last
But we’re too human to see the way we’ll agonize

[Chorus]
A real love survives
A rock steady vibe
A real love survives
A rock steady vibe

[Verse 2]
Steady now stop rocking it
It’s a delicate environment
Retired but sleeping is our shanty love
Be careful now, don’t wake it up

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s never gonna last
It’s never gonna make it back alive
So now can we relax?
I really hope that we will actually survive
[Chorus]
A real love survives
A rock steady vibe

Just another shooting star strung out on your wire
Prick my finger on his virgin silver
He took me raw, ginger, caramelise me

Gotta hang these bones out to dry
He loved me, he loved me, ravishingly low
Gonna hang these bones out to dry

So you get done, then you get some
Sure enough, it won't hold you for long
Then you say, ""Right. This is all mine.""
But hasn't your donor card expired?
From Blueridge to Cattail on the prairie
From flyover country, back through Mississippi
I said, ""Go, man, you go.""
But you raise me twenty, I'm raising you five-
Hundred treaties signed by your fathers' lies
Go, man, you go
'Cause I'm trailing her tears
The ones you won't hold
You roll me a carpet, roll me a carpet, boy
Roll me a carpet from here to Oklahoma

No one is there to meet her
Something of a sad one
A girl with permanent tears
Born without a family
Born without a name
And all she ever wanted
Was to wipe her tears away

Wipe her tears away
Away.........away

If someone came to love her
And if someone came to be
The one that will protect her
Be a family
Now we will see a smile again
And tears like dreams can be
Something we will never see
Lost in her memory

Wipe her tears away
Away.........away
Wipe her tears away
Tears away......away......away
She's something of a tragedy
Stands in the shade of despair
I want to cast some light onto her world
A world of permanent tears
Born without a family
Born without a name
Free this weeping willow
From drowning in a flood of tears

Wipe her tears away
Tears away......away......away (REPEAT)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",pop
1654,No Use for a Name,Born Addicted,angry,"A woman sits inside a room
Enclosing her lungs with deadly fumes
Her boyfriend left a long time ago
I guess he didn't know...
She'd skip lamaze class every night
Stays at home with her mouth to the pipe
A basehead in full maternity
When my baby is born ""It'll look just like me""
No responsibility, the baby is born addicted
Drugged automatically the infantile life is inflicted
Extroversion has taken her control
It's given name was Jack, but it might as well be crack
Born deaf, dumb and blind, what she left behind
Is only left to die...WHY!
If you take a life don't take one with you
Don't pass your disease to someone else

1655,Immortal Technique,The 4th Branch,angry,"[Intro]
The new age is upon us
And yet the past refuses to rest in its shallow grave
For those who hide behind the false image of the son of man
Shall stand before God (God, God, God, God, God, God, God)
It has begun, the beginning of the end
Yeah ... yeah ... yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
The voice of racism preaching the gospel is devilish
A fake church called the prophet Muhammad a terrorist
Forgetting God is not religion, but a spiritual bond
And Jesus is the most quoted prophet in the Qu'ran
They bombed innocent people, tryna murder Saddam
When you gave him those chemical weapons to go to war with Iran
This is the information that they hold back from Peter Jennings
'Cause Condoleeza Rice is just a new age Sally Hemings
I break it down with critical language and spiritual anguish
The Judas I hang with, the guilt of betraying Christ
You murdered him, stole his religion, and painted him white
Translated in psychologically tainted philosophy
Conservative political right-wing ideology
Glued together sloppily, the blasphemy of a nation
Got my back to the wall 'cause I'm facin' assassination
Guantanamo Bay, federal incarceration
How could this be the land of the free, home of the brave
Indigenous holocaust, and the home of the slaves?
Corporate America dancin' offbeat to the rhythm
You really think this country never sponsored terrorism?
Human rights violations, we continue the saga
El Savador and the Contras in Nicaragua
And on top of that, you still want to take me to prison
Just 'cause I won't trade humanity for patriotism
[Chorus]
It's like MKUltra, controllin' your brain
Suggestive thinkin’, causin’ your perspective to change
They want to rearrange the whole point of view of the ghetto
The fourth branch of the government want us to settle
A bandanna full of glittering generality
Fightin' for freedom and fightin' terror, but what's reality?
Read about the history of the place that we live in
And stop letting corporate news tell lies to your children

[Verse 2]
Flow like the blood of Abraham through the Jews and the Arabs
Broken apart like a woman's heart, abused in a marriage
The brink of holy war, bottled up like a miscarriage
Embedded correspondents don't tell the source of the tension
And they refuse to even mention European intervention
Or the massacres in Jenin, the innocent screams
US-manufactured missiles and M16s
Weapon contracts and corrupted American dreams
Media censorship blockin’ out the video screens
A continent of oil kingdoms bought for a bargain
Democracy is just a word when the people are starvin'
The average citizen made to be blind to the reason
A desert full of genocide where the bodies are freezin'
And the world doesn't believe that you fightin' for freedom
'Cause you fucked the Middle East and gave birth to a demon
It's open season with the CIA buggin' my crib
Trapped in a ghetto region like a Palestinian kid
Where nobody gives a fuck whether you die or you live
I'm tryna give the truth and I know the price is my life
But when I'm gone they'll sing a song about Immortal Technique
Who beheaded the president and the princes and sheiks
You don't give a fuck about us, I can see through your facade
Like a fallen angel standing in the presence of God
Bitch niggas scared of the truth when it looks at you hard
[Chorus]
It's like MKUltra, controllin' your brain
Suggestive thinkin’, causin’ your perspective to change
They want to rearrange the whole point of view of the ghetto
The fourth branch of the government want us to settle
A bandanna full of glittering generality
Fightin' for freedom and fightin' terror, but what's reality?
Martial law is coming soon to the hood to kill you
While you hangin’ your flag out your project window

[Outro]
Yeah
The fourth branch of the government AKA the media
Seems to now have a retirement plan for ex-military officials
As if their opinion was at all unbiased
A machine shouldn't speak for men
So shut the fuck up, you mindless drone
And you know it's serious
When these same media outfits are spending millions of dollars on a PR campaign
To try to convince you they're fair and balanced
When they're some of the most ignorant and racist people
Giving that type of mentality a safe haven
We act like we share in the spoils of war that they do
We die in wars, we don't get the contracts to make money off 'em afterwards
We don't get weapons contracts, nigga
We don't get cheap labor for our companies, nigga
We are cheap labor, nigga

1656,The Format,On Your Porch (acoustic),sad,"I was on your porch
The smoke sank into my skin
So I came inside to be with you

We talked all night
About everything you could imagine
'Cause come the morning, I'll be gone

And as our eyes start to close
I turn to you and I let you know
That I love you

Well my dad was sick
My mom, she cared for him
Her loving nursed him back to life

And me, I ran
I couldn't even look at him
For fear I'd have to say goodbye

And as I start to leave
He grabs me by the shoulder and he tells me
""What's left to lose?
You've done enough
And if you fail, well then you fail, but not to us
'Cause these last three years
I know they have been hard
But now it's time to get out of the desert and into the sun
Even if it's alone""

So now here I sit
In a hotel off of Sunset
My thoughts bounce off Sam's guitar

And that's the way its been
Ever since we were kids, but now
Now, we've got something to prove

And I, I can see their eyes
But tell me something, can they see mine?
'Cause what's left to lose?
I've done enough
And if I fail, then I fail, but I gave it a shot

'Cause these last three years
I know they have been hard
But now it's time to get out of the desert and into the sun
Even if it's alone

Dog days of summer
Heat haze and bad temper
And whole days of shouting
""Would you listen to me?""
See, I'm the one in charge now
What happened to me?
I turned into someone's mother

[Chorus]
Really someone should give me a uniform
Or someone should show me where is the door
Or someone should come around and explain
How it is that love forgets to speak its name

[Verse 2]
And then you turn on the news
And it's somebody else's news
And it's always such bad news
And I'm no good with sad news anymore
Gets me running upstairs
To count heads in tangled beds

[Chorus]
And someone tears up that uniform
And somewhere gently closes a door
And I'm right here once more
Crying, confessing, counting my blessings
Don't let go
'Cause we'll never know
That even when the sky is clear
And the moon looks really close
Well it's nowhere nearEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",r&b

When those that you keep blind will suddenly realize
Maybe it's a part of me you took
To a place I hoped it would never go
And maybe that fucked me up

They bide their time till the dinner bell
Take a swing with a bag, and they wait
By the school gate

All this pushin and shovin
When you need a little lovin
A little human kindness
But where you gonna find it?

So you close your bedroom door
And you kneel down on the floor
Cause you don't want to get caught
Packing the bag that your mother doesn't even
Know you bought

""So it's come to this"" you cry
Not even time to say goodbye
You pack some cigarettes and an A-Z
Push the suitcase back under the bed
You've been balanced on a knife
Will the city save your life?
You've been waiting for so long
Just for somewhere to feel like home

You've been balanced on a knife
Will the city save your life?
Your life is waiting for you
Love is waiting for you

So pack your cigarettes
And your A-Z
It'll be just like that book you readEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",r&b

1670,Despised Icon,In The Arms Of Perdition,angry,"Plunged in bitterness
Seduced by an ocean of discontent
Carrying an everlasting smile with insouciance
Cultivating this disconnection with every single interaction

You won't lure me any further
I've been drinking too much shadow and now maybe I shall blossom
This misconception of human loneliness must be disregarded

I will stare at life like I never did before
This game is useless and everything so deceptive
My ambitions may look low but so is the price. I cannot win
What's the meaning of this precious souvenir?
Suppress these feelings

Forget the man you were
Even if we both knew that you'd rather be unloved and...
Forget the man you were
...nameless than be fictively surrounded

Carrying an everlasting smile with insouciance
I honestly know that demons will not hear me scream
And angels won't see me cry
Isolation is in the fact that the only thing I require
No false promises await in my nightmares
Nothing, except my own predestined downfall
Look at this smile and think I'm cheerful like you always were...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",metal

Of these castle walls
Lies a world I'm not a part of
Forbidden to even think for myself
Dared to step outside the line
For fear of torture

I always wanted to know
How to kill a king
Use his madness against him
Forsake everything
Though his grip is so tight
And it's choking me
I will find a way out
Of this loyalty

Just when I thought I was
Running out of time
The King stood trembling at my bedside
He said ""if you leave me now
My suicide will follow""
And I said ""what are you waiting for?""

Now I know
How to kill a king
Now he suffers in silence
With a poisonous sting
He could not steal my might
And it seems to be
I have found a way out
Of his loyalty
I know that I can survive
Outside this cage
Maybe now I can fight through
All this rage

I'm so glad I knew
How to kill the King
I tore down the boundaries
And took off the ring
To reap what you sow
Is how it should be
There's no one left on the throne

Never slept with a dream before he had to go away
There's a bell in the tower, Uncle Ray bought a round
Don't worry about the army in the cold cold ground
Cold cold ground
Cold cold ground
Cold cold ground

Now don't be a crybaby when there's wood in the shed
There's a bird in the chimney and a stone in my bed
When the road's washed out, we pass the bottle around
And wait in the arms of the cold cold ground
The cold cold ground
In the cold cold ground
In the cold cold ground

There's a ribbon in the willow, there's a tire-swing rope
There's a briar patch of berries takin' over the slope
The cat'll sleep in the mailbox and we'll never go to town
Till we bury every dream in the cold cold ground
In the cold cold ground
In the cold cold ground
In the cold cold ground
In the cold cold ground

Give me a Winchester rifle and a whole box of shells
Blow the roof off the goat barn, let it roll down the hill
The piano is firewood, Times Square is a dream
I find we'll lay down together in the cold cold ground
In the cold cold ground
The cold cold ground
In the cold cold ground
We'll call the cops on the Breedloves, bring a Bible and a rope
And a whole box of Rebel and a bar of soap
Make a pile of trunk tires and burn 'em all down
Bring a dollar with you, baby, in the cold cold ground
In the cold cold ground
In the cold cold ground

Stop talking to the neighbors until we all go dead

He had a Queen Bee Rules tattoo on his arm
He asked me if I'd be his date for the prom
And he'd buy me a horse, a Porsche and a farm
Dan, my nigga from down south
Used to like me to spank him and cum in his mouth
And Tony, he was Italian
He didn't give a fuck that's what I liked about him
He ate my pussy from dark till the mornin'
Called his girl up and told her we was bonin'
Puerto Rican papi used to be a Deacon
But now he be suckin' me off on the weekend
And this black dude I called King Kong
He had a big ass dick and a hurricane tongue

Stop, look and listen, get back to your position

Lunatics in the street, gotta keep the heat
Sixty on the bezel, a hunnid on the rings
Sittin' pretty baby with a Cash Money bling
12 a.m., I'm on the way to the club
After three bottles I'll be ready to fuck
Some niggas even put me on their grocery list
Right next to the whip cream and box of chocolate

Lick it right the first time or you gotta do it over

The city was sticky and cruel
Maybe I should have called you first

I was dreaming while I drove

Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you

Keeps us from tearing apart?
No matter where I go I hear
The beating of your heart
I think about you
When the night is cold and da-ah-ark

No one can move me the way that you do
Nothing erases the feeling between me and you

Anarchy, disarray—this is the world today
Justice is a lie for the followers to get by
No peace, only guns—can't trust anyone

And it's safe to say there is no other way

Brazen hypocrites answering to idiots
New tax, market crash—high life never lasts
No quick fix for broken politics

Individual pain is a strong incentive
Infiltrate with fear, keeping penance ever near
Punish with indecency and mutilate for all to see

Mines explode, pain shears through your brain
Radical amputation, this is insane
Fly swatter stakes drive through your chest
Spikes impale you as you're forced off the crest
Soldier of misfortune
Hunting with bated breath
A vile smell, like tasting death
Dead bodies, dying and wounded
Litter the city streets
Shattered glass, bits of clothing and human deceit
Dying in terror
Blood's cheap, it's everywhere
Mandatory suicide, massacre on the front line

I found my place in the chain
Even damnation is poisoned with rainbows
All the brave young men
They're waiting now to see a signal
Which some killer will be lighting for pay

Into this furnace I ask you now to venture
You whom I cannot betray
I fought in the old revolution
On the side of the ghost and the king
Of course I was very young
And I thought that we were winning
I can't pretend I still feel very much like singing
As they carry the bodies away
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture
You whom I cannot betray
Lately you've started to stutter
As though you had nothing to say
To all of my architects let me be traitor
Now let me say I myself gave the order
To sleep and to search and to destroy
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture
You whom I cannot betray

Yes, you who are broken by power
You who are absent all day
You who are kings for the sake of your children's story

The hand of your lover is clay

And he flies out the door
With the easy money
Because there ain't no man

Who got any of that bread

The hotter it hooks

A yellow ribbon instead of a swastika
Nothin' proper about ya propaganda
Fools follow rules when the set commands ya
Said it was blue, when ya blood was red
That's how ya got a bullet blasted through ya head
Blasted through ya head, blasted through ya head
I give a shout out to the living dead
Who stood and watched as the feds cold centralized
So serene on the screen, you was mesmerized
Cellular phones, soundin' a death tone
Corporations cold turn ya to stone before ya realize
They load the clip in, omnicolor
Said they pack the nine, they fire it at prime time
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
And mothafuckas lost their minds!

1706,Björn Rosenström,Lurad,happy,"I går kväll ringde jag på en kontaktannons i tidningen
Idag så fick jag träffa henne som jag ringt till
Nyfiken på vad det var för gris i säck jag hade köpt
Ringde jag på dörren och så öppnade hon
Hon kom ifrån Arboga, jag synade henne noga
Och efter ordentligt övervägande jag sa:

Det stod att du var snygg
Men du är ful, jag har blivit lurad
Du skrev nåt om ett slott
Det här är ett skjul, jag har blivit lurad

Nu är det faktiskt så, sa hon, att jag tycker att jag är snygg
Så du kan inte stämma mig för lureri
Jag skiter väl i stämning, sa jag, men jag kräver att
Du ber om ursäkt och erkänner att du ser ut som stryk
Men jag fick inte ut ett jota, trots att jag hota
Med att rycka hår ur hennes snok

Det stod att du var snygg
Men du är ful, jag har blivit lurad
Du skrev nåt om ett slott
Det här är ett skjul, jag har blivit lurad

Nu satt jag uti klistret, ni förstår hur svårt jag hade
Jag kunde inte dra mig ur med äran i behåll
Jag var redan sur, men när jag fick dörren rätt i nyllet
Balla jag ur och börja gå bärsärkargång
Jag fick upp en sten och drog den genom hennes fönster
Sen tryckte jag in huvudet mitt så långt jag kunde och skrek:
Det stod att du var snygg
Men du är ful, jag har blivit lurad
Du skrev nåt om ett slott
Det här är ett skjul, jag har blivit lurad

Han är blåst, han är blåst, han har blivit lurad
Han får gå hem med svansen mellan benen
Han är blåst, han är blåst, han har blivit lurad
Han får gå hem med svansen mellan benen
Han är blåst, han är blåst, han har blivit lurad
Han får gå hem med svansen mellan benen
Han är blåst, han är blåst, han har blivit lurad
Han får gå hem med svansen mellan benen
Han är blåst, han är blåst, han har blivit lurad
Han får gå hem med svansen mellan benen
Han är blåst, han är blåst, han har blivit lurad
Han får gå hem med svansen mellan benen
Han är blåst, han är blåst, han har blivit lurad
Han får gå hem med svansen mellan benen

We'll fly our flag right up up out of your sky

So puff out your chest in some weird dusty fight
We're taking no part in your cracked antique life

We're living at night trying to pull out the light

We'll turn up the heat as we burn up you boxes
We'll loosen our wrists as we fill in your foxholes
You've got your bad apples to ruin your bunch

If you want me now, you can have me now
If you want me down, I will get really low
You better believe I'll be down by your shoes
If you want it all, you can have it all
If you want some more, come and get some more
Cause the dirt feels good when you're underground
You better believe that we're all getting down
You know that us feral kids love straying about
So start giving in, yeah you better get down

So we leave them to head our salvation

He died in Dallas town

I should take it like a man

But if you've got to go then you've got to know
That it's killing me
And all the things I never seem to show
I've got to make you see

Girl, it's been so long
(Tell me) Tell me how could it be
One of us knows the two of us don't belong
In each others company

It hurts so much inside, you're telling me goodbye
You want to be free
And knowing that you're gone and leaving me behind
I gotta make you see
I gotta make you see
I gotta make you see

I should win at any cost
But now I see as the smoke clears away

I'm out of your life
Tonight I'll dream away and you can still be mine
But I'm dreaming a lie
Dreaming a lie
Makes me want to die

Could never cause me pain

While I was thinking about her dress
I was shy I turned away
Before she caught my eye
I was shaking in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

Too magical to touch
To see her in that negligee
Is really just too much

With a big black gaping hole where the heart should be

While all the niggas enter the game, they caught up in this drug dealing
Now how can I fall? how can I ball?
How can I catch my enemies and murder 'em all?

Niggas don't wanna see me worldwide, mob figure

Niggas, don’t wanna see me, when I got weed in my system
Catch another victim, catchin' bodies
Bring a shotty to the fucking party, yeah
I party all night
I do this shit 'cause it's wrong but we born right
And to these niggas in my zone, we do it long ways
'Til these bitches understand nigga my song pays; 'cause I'm the man
Now these is my homeboys, we outlaws 'til the day we die
Keep this shit, rough and raw

Filling in the blanks and gaps

I'm working on drawing a straight line
And I'll draw until I get one right
It's bold and dark girl, can't you see

Why should I stay and play my lousy role?

Don't wanna remain
Now - the time is right
Won't be too difficult
To give up the last fight

Fear of the moment
My world is a maze with a dead end
Fear of the moment
The will to live is hard to defend

If I - would pass away
Would they ever miss me
Maybe just for one day?
If I - would have real friends
The dead end would make no fucking sense

1729,Cradle of Filth,Filthy Little Secret,angry,"There hides a secret
Deeply twined inside of her mind
A tried and confined egret
That pines to fly south
To this mouth of mine

Pity

Too long have these emotions
Like potions, made me
A sole castellan
Trusted to keep
The weight of oceans
From her rusted gates of sleep

A dreaming angel
Lying curled in the circles of Hell
I must protect her
Watch her back for any cracks to occur
For in the witching hour
She slips into the underworld
A pearled Persephone
Deflowered by the powers
Hat around her
Down her
Whirl
Doomed to damn the rift
Across the shifting abyss
With her body and its gift
My filthy little secret

I serve her slender hope
To preserve mankind from old ghosts
Disturbed though by recurring crimes
I sense that dead
Might be best for both

Pity

Too long have these emotions
Like potions, made me
A sole castellan
Posted to keep
Slow wheels in motion
From the human race to beat

Without her there
My nymphetamine with the faraway stare
Thin walls would crumble
Horrors would corroborate from dogstar lairs
For in the dead of the night
She spasms with orgasmic flare
This reamed Demeter
With Poseidons there inside her
Too appeased to grieve our air
Doomed to dam the rift
Across the shifting abyss
With her body and its gift
My filthy little secret

Forever sworn to keep it
My filthy little secret
She makes me borne

Pity
Too long this urchin princess
Has incensed, made me
A wanton felon
Searching for the key
To loose her harness
And set desires lurching free

Without her there
My nymphetamine with the faraway stare
Thin walls would crumble
Horrors would corroborate from dogstar lair
But in her room at night
I care not for the underworld
Slathering and gathering emboldened Reichs
To breach, to teach
A dread thereafter
I would risk all this
For one minute of bliss
With her body and its gift
My filthy little secret

Forever sworn to keep it
My filthy little secret

I know a deeper beauty shines
Beyond the veil
Her roots and creepers mine
As the worms beneath ariseEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",metal

They realized there was a hole in the boat
And with no lifesaver you try your best to float

And eventually the sky did return
And I was there outside in green
And I watched the world being reborn 'til 1 AM
So I thought I'd let you know
It was beautiful, slow dancing to tunes of Billie Holiday
The city looked wonderful that way
And love, just like blood will always stain

And if I could reverse it
I don't think that it'd be worth it

1739,Jarvis Cocker,Running The World,angry,"Well did you hear, there's a natural order
Those most deserving will end up with the most
That the cream cannot help but always rise up to the top
Well I say, ""Shit floats""

If you thought things had changed
Friend, you better think again
Bluntly put, in the fewest of words
Cunts are still running the world
Cunts are still running the world

Now the working classes are obsolete
They are surplus to society's needs
So let 'em all kill each other
And get it made overseas

That's the word, don't you know
From the guys that's running the show
Let's be perfectly clear boys and girls
Cunts are still running the world
Cunts are still running the world

Ah yeah
Oh yeah

Well feed your children on crayfish and lobster tails
Find a school near the top of the league
In theory I respect your right to exist
I will kill ya if ya' move in next to me
Ah, it stinks, it sucks, it's anthropologically unjust
Oh, but the takings are up by a third, oh so
Cunts are still running the world
Cunts are still running the world

(Cunts are still running the world
Cunts are still running the world)

The free market is perfectly natural
Do you think that I'm some kind of dummy?
It's the ideal way to order the world
""Fuck the morals, does it make any money?""
And if you don't like it, then leave
Or use your right to protest on the street
Yeah use your right, but don't imagine that it's heard

Cunts are still running the world

I stab you right between the eyes
You awaken from the lies
I've said it ever since its inception
They're the masters of deception
I'm a godless heretic
Not a God-fearing lunatic
That's why it's become my obsession
To treat God like an infection

My scars: insane
My life: profane
I deny, defy
And spread a little hate worldwide

Religious doubt, I instigate
Take a listen to my confession
There's no filter on my aggression
With a pistol open wide
To keep the massacre alive
I'll cause global devastation
With my moral imperfection

My scars: insane
My life: profane
I deny, defy
And spread a little hate worldwide

From what the Bible demonstrates
Does it document creation?
Or just hopelessness of fiction?

To treat God like an infection

And spread a little hate world

Means to an end ended in disgrace
Perspective is lost in the spirit of the chase

Barren land that once filled a need
Are worthless now, dead without a deed
Slipping away from an iron grip
Nature's scales are forced to tip
The heartland cries, loss of all pride
To leave ain't believin', so try and be tried
Insufficient funds, insanity, and suicide

Break new ground of a new frontier

You'll find the solution
The answer's in the sky

Fui convidado pra uma tal de suruba
Não pude ir, Maria foi no meu lugar
Depois de uma semana, ela voltou pra casa
Toda arregaçada, não podia nem sentar
Quando vi aquilo, fiquei assustado
Maria, chorando, começou a me explicar
Aí, então, eu fiquei aliviado
E dei ""Graças a Deus"" porque ela foi no meu lugar

Ó, Manuel, olha cá como eu estou
Tu não imaginas como eu estou sofrendo
Uma teta minha, um negão arrancou
E a outra que sobrou está doendo

Tu ficaste tão bonita monoteta
Mais vale um na mão do que dois no sutiã

And life, life is a mystery
Until you came to me

And we'll have high hopes
But if it don't work out
We won't be dismayed
'Cause love, love is our guiding force
And it will remain

Or did I dream it all the time?

When will these ideas really be my own?
Because this moment keeps on moving

This was a scene worth waking up for
When I woke up
You planted me in my own pot
Don't know why
But somehow it just feels so wrong

When you're sad, I will be lonely
But when you rise again I'll have become the sun
I will shine down upon you
As if you were the only one

Your voice is your own, I can't protect it
You'll have to sing
A verse no one has ever known
Don't be afraid

Made up to make children behave
So our souls are safe to wander off
Wherever they might please
Your soul is safe wherever you might be

Come now, sleep
Come, now sleep

Tell me I'm only dreaming
Tell me he's just sleeping
And when morning comes
We'll both wake up to see the sun
And love that's enough to keep our friends alive

Phone call
I pull my car to the side of the road
No, it's not the cold making my legs shake
It's someone I love being taken away
A ghost taking his place in our hearts
Where inside he moves from room to room
But sometimes he climbs our spines
To remind our grieving heads
That in this way he hasn't left

Tell me I'm only dreaming
Tell me he's just sleeping

Our wedding song will be ebony and ivory
And we’ll sing Christmas carols around the old Kwanzaa tree
But color is not the issue here, it's dignity it's class
It’s all about her heart ok it’s partly about that ass

I want me some black girls, the brown girls the café au lait

Death walks inside you
Smell death around you
Hell's evil spell takes a soul
Hear the sound of the bell
Counting off death tolls

Searching for human flesh
And life's blood

1762,Eliane Elias,Chega De Saudade,relaxed,"Vai, minha tristeza
E diz a ela que sem ela não pode ser
Diz lhe numa prece que ela regresse
Porque eu não posso mais sofrer
Chega de saudade, a realidade
É que sem ela não há paz, não há beleza
É só tristeza, e a melancolia
Que não sai de mim, não sai de mim, não sai
Mas se ela voltar, se ela voltar
Que coisa linda, que coisa louca
Pois há menos peixinhos a nadar no mar
Do que os beijinhos que eu darei na sua boca
Dentro dos meus braços os abraços
Hão de ser milhões de abraços apertado assim
Colado assim, calado assim
Abraços e beijinhos e carinhos sem ter fim
Que é pra acabar com esse negócio
De viver longe de mim
Não quero mais esse negócio
De você viver assim
Vamos deixar desse negócio
De você viver sem mimEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",easy listening
1763,Demon Hunter,My Heartstrings Come Undone,sad,"[Verse 1]
It’s buried deep within the past and I hope it doesn’t last
(It’s something I already chase, I already chase)
I try to give it all away, but it’s never going to fade
(It’s something I don’t want to face, I don’t want to face)
I know you feel it’s all the same, but I promise that I’ll change
(It’s something I already chase, I already chase)
You know I’m trying to believe that you’re never going to leave
(It’s something I don’t want to face, I don’t want to face)

There’s nothing left, the fear is gone

And when my heartstrings come undone
I will wait for you, pray for you
Before I make my final run
I will stay with you, decay with you
[Verse 2]
I know I’m not the perfect one and this has pain just begun
(It’s something I already chase, I already chase)
You bring me to a better path, and it’s everything I lack
(It’s something I don’t want to face, I don’t want to face)

There’s nothing left, the fear is gone
There’s nothing left, the fear is gone
And when my heartstrings come undone
I will wait for you, pray for you
Before I make my final run
I will stay with you, decay with you

If you fade out without me will you know all about me?
If you fade out without me will you know all?

And when my heartstrings come undone
I will wait for you, pray for you
Before I make my final run
I will stay with you, decay with you

And when my heartstrings come undone
I will wait for you, pray for you
Before I make my final run

Hell I ain't going nowhere
I got the reigns and courage I was made of
And they've got fake love

I must go with my soul
Not my hand where I stand

Pearls and necklaces and girls and all the pretty things
I ain't seeking to have
It's safe to say if I don't get this out of me I might quite easily
End up dead or just mad
Cross my t's and try to dot my i's
But that's just blinding me and I ain't living that way
I roll my sleeves to make a better man of me or I might easily
Just give up on this show

With my chains tied up to my feet
I leaned instead of jiggie with the sidewalk
Now this street tells the same old boring tale
That has failed in so many ways of life
To trust its stories you've got to be dull as them

And all the love I've got in here you've just killed
You peasants didn't even care
The love I had in store you raped for more
And all the dreams I had in here you've just stolen
You peasants didn't even care
But the dreams I had for her you cannot touch, my golden hand
Cause it's guarded by your promises
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I met her in a crowded room where the bookshelves help you and knowledge takes your hand
I watched her beauty from an armchair
I said ""Hey girl have you seen that film with those kids in New York in the eighties
Oh, you have – Well, can I watch it with you anyway""

And all the love I've got in here you've just killed

How does it feel to ride all those horses?
You cannot touch our hearts when we're in bloom
I assume that we'll win over the heads again
We conceal none, you'll feel none, that's what I promise
And all the love we've got in store, you can't kill you peasants!
We won it all
And the love I have for her you cannot touch, my golden hand

1772,The Most Serene Republic,Proposition 61,relaxed,"What we need is a good jump kick, jump kick
To the head to get our ambitions in gear
For example, Jude at the party was taking her clothes off
Below the constellations

Outside the people, they pranced becoming lord of the dance
Another typical social plights
We greeted them with conversation and delight
Since Jude was mad at her dream for landing nowhere near the marker

To a boat on a island where nobody?s been
Except your best memories and your favorite friends
There ain't no self fished for dinner

This is a place, is a place, is a place, is a place
Is a place that's soft down in a chair
We?ll talk till the break, till the break, till the break
Till the sun comes up like the signal flare

Jude trailed off the trail, got her tail caught in a fail-proof safe
Didn't really fail for a night in jail with pale hail of everywhere
The nightingale did escape the whale
Couldn't we survive, they are fed alive, we all cried
Because she went and jumped overboard

She took a sad song, made it sadder
She took a sad song, made it sadder
She took a sad song, made it sadder
She took a sad song, made it sadder
She took a sad song, made it sadder

1774,The Arrogant Worms,Johnny Came Home Headless,happy,"Oh, Johnny was a tall man but his memory was short
He'd forget to duck at doorways and often he'd get hurt
I took good care of him for he had no family
Actually he did, but he forgot who they be

Johnny often liked to go out on the town
He'd forget where he'd be going so he'd just wander around
I when he was back for I would hear the smack
Of his head hitting the doorway but tonight it was alack

Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace
But wherever it's a-lying there's a smile upon his face
I should have seen it coming, he finally lost his mind
But if his head don't turn up soon then all his hats are mine

Johnny came towards me but suddenly he stopped
As if trying to think of something but having no luck
Still he didn't notice that his head weren't there
'Til he took out a brush and tried to comb his hair

I said, ""Johnny where's your cranium?"" but he didn't seem to know
He just shrugged his shoulders and tried to find his nose
And the sight of him there topless made me start to cry
For I feared we'd ne'er again see eye to eye

Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace
But wherever it's a-lying there's a smile upon his face
I should have seen it coming, he should have stayed in bed
For now I fear he'll spend his life just trying to get ahead
Refusing to believe that he had split for good
His lower half and me searched the neighbourhood
It soon became apparent that his head we wouldn't find it
He could not retrace his steps, he was absent minded

Well years went by til late one night I heard a voice I swore
Was Johnny calling out to me, I flung open the door
Johnny's head was home, it took a taxi cab
Alas, it was too late, his body had gone bad

Johnny's head was homeless, his body was cremated
And the funeral was harder than he had anticipated
I should of seen it coming he said in his eulogy
But never thought I'd have to say I ain't got no-body

(I ain't got nobody)

Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace
But now his head's upon a shelf, a smile upon his face

Last thing I sweat's a sucka punk cop
Move like a king when I roll, hops
You try to flex, bang, another nigga drops
You gotta deal with this cause there's no way out
Why? Cash money ain't never gonna play out
I got nothin to lose, much to gain
In my brain, I got a capitalist migraine
I gotta get paid tonight, you muthafuckin right
Pickin' my grip, check my bitch, keep my game tight
So many hoes on my jock, think I'm a movie star
Nineteen, I got a fifty thousand dollar car
Go to school, I ain't goin for it
Kiss my ass, bust the cap on the Moet

As I stride, my gold chains glide back and forth
I care nothing 'bout you, and that's evident
All I love's my dope and dead presidents
Sound crazy? Well it isn't
The ends justifies the means, that's the system
I learned that in school then I dropped out
Hit the streets, checked a grip, and now I got clout
I had nothing, and I wanted it
You had everything, and you flaunted it
Turned the needy into the greedy
With cocaine, my success came speedy
Got me twisted, jammed into a paradox
Every dollar I get, another brother drops
Maybe that's the plan, and I don't understand
God damn----you got me sinkin in quicksand
But since I don't know, and I ain't never learned
I gotta get paid, I got money to earn
With my posse, out on the ave
Bump my sounds, crack a forty and laugh
Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam
Is this a nightmare? Or the American dream?
So think twice if you're coming down my block
You wanna journey through hell? Well shit gets hot
Pregnant teens, children's screams
Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam
You don't come here much, and ya better not
Wrong move (bang), ambulance cot
I gotta get more money than you got
So what, if some motherfucker gets shot?
That's how the game is played
Another brother slayed, the wound is deep
But they're givin us a band aid
My education's low but I got long dough
I'm raised like a pit bull, my heart pumps nitro
Sleep on silk, lie like a politician
My Uzi's my best friend, cold as a mortician
Lock me up, it's genocidal catastrophe

Just my undivided honesty

1783,Dave Matthews Band,I Did It,relaxed,"[Verse 1]
I'm mixing up a bunch of magic stuff
A magic mushroom cloud of care
A potion that'll rock, the boat will rock
I'll make a bomb of love and blow it up

[Chorus 1]
I did it, do you think I've gone too far?
I did it, guilty as charged
I did it, it was me right or wrong
I did it, yeah

[Chorus 2]
I never did a single thing that did a single thing
To change the ugly ways of the world
I didn't know it felt so right inside
I didn't know it all

[Chorus 3]
And I opened up the curtains
I heard sirens there, the lights flash and crawl
But I did it justice

[Verse 2]
I just did it for us all
It's a nickel or a dime for what I've done
The truth is that I don't really care
For such a lovely crime I'll do the time
You better lock me up, I'll do it again

[Chorus 3]
I open up the curtains
I heard sirens there, the lights flash and crawl

All you people are the skewers of our dreams
Like the cat that collared me
Oh, what I gotta say to you, you got love
Don't turn it down, turn it loud, let it build
We got a long way to go
But you, you got to start somewhere
Go door to door, spread the love you got
You got the love, you get what you want
Does it matter where you get it from?
I for one, don't turn my cheek for anyone
Unturn your cheek to give your love
Love to grow

[Chorus 1]
I did it, do you think I've gone too far?
I did it, guilty as charged
I did it, it was me right or wrong
I did it, yeah, yeah, yeah

1787,Okkervil River,It Ends With a Fall,sad,"Wish I could remember why it mattered to me
It doesn't matter to me
It doesn't matter to me anymore
Now that you're feeling fine
I'll admit that - though I know it's coming down
And see it shattering me - it doesn't matter to me
And I'm not sadder for seeing it come
I'm not going to run
I will just come when I am called

You want to cut me off
Because I took too much
But don't leave me alone
Take off your scarves, your winter coat
The night's too cold

When we met I should have said
You're like a sister to me
How all that kiss her just seem
Like puny suitors I can see through
How none will do, not for you
It might as well just be us two
And when I pulled you by the jacket
From the clattering street
You started flattering me
You started saying I was so strong
String me along, but I can't become all that I'm called
And I can't claim to know
What makes love die or grow
But I can still take control
And so refuse to just go home
Back down the hall

And as I crawl
As finally all the false confetti blooms up in this attic room
I'm going make my stand
I want to see both of your hands put down the phone
I won't let you go
Although the moment stole my self-control
From us all and now it can only end with a fallEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",country

1791,Richard Hawley,For Your Lover Give Some Time,sad,"It was your birthday yesterday
I gave a gift that almost took your breath away
But to be honest, I nearly left it on the train
For your lover give some time

You talk forever on the phone
To your mother and with my thoughts I'm left alone
Now and then I think how strange our love has grown
For your lover give some time
I will give up these cigarettes
Stay at home and watch you mend a tear in your dress
Have your name in a rose tattooed across my chest
And be your lover for all time
Maybe I will drink a little less
Come home early and not complain about the day
And give you flowers from the graveyard now and then
For your lover give some time

I think of places that I've seen
A skipping stone across the ocean I have been
A rootless man with no one else to share my dreams
And for my lover gave no time
Here's a toast to you, Helene
To all the cinemas we ran in from the rain
Laughing, clutching soaking newspapers to your face
And for your love you gave some time
I will give up these cigarettes
Stay at home and watch you mend the tears in your dress
Have your name in a rose tattooed across my chest
And be your lover for all time
Maybe I will drink a little less
Come home early and not complain about the day
And give you flowers from the graveyard now and then
And for my lover give some time

I've spent my last night
Strung up and pulled tight
Holding out, sleeping proud
An answer comes without a ""please""
Do what you want

Wonder why I'm so caught off guard when we kiss
I'd rather live my life in regret than do this
What happened to the love we both knew?
We both chased?
Hanging on a cigarette
You need me
You burn me
You'll burn me

Hushed with a finger
Don't say you'll never when you might
Oh, just another time
This poison comes instruction free
Do what you want, but I'm drinking

1793,Moxy Früvous,Entropy,happy,"(Mike in a deep voice)
Galileo, Netwon, Watt, they were genuises all
Without them we'd be freezing in the dark at the mall
James Joule found total energy remains the same
(Murray)
No matter what it's form
(Mike)
That's why it carries his name

(Jian)
Mechanical, electrical, potential and heat
Radiant, kinetic, ooh the list is incomplete
They're always changing back and forth
It's really quite a blur
(Murray)
Oh, how could he?
(Jian)
I've forgotten nuclear!

(All)
Ride a barrel down the falls
Then cook spaghetti with meatballs
Really make your friends amazed
Nuke it with some gamma rays
Fly to Venus in a rocket
Put your finger in a socket
You may suffer from exhaust
But none of that energy is ever really lost
(Murray)
Then why can't we make a clean machine that moves perpetually?
Cause there's another law with which all energy must agree
Whenever it changes form, it loses quality

(Dave)
In other words...

(Murray)
Down/Damn that rising entropy!

(Dave)
It's entropy you see that turns finess into mess
A palace to a pig-stye why it's simply scandalous!
Energy once neat degenerates into waste heat (We must repeat.)
Because of entropy

1794,American Music Club,The Confidential Agent,sad,"Take the velvet line for comfort
High above the water, feel disconnected and free
Tired of hopes that I just can't run from
I travel in secret, I know they're pursuing me

Morning that falls represents a weak link
After is after night's work is done
There's no sun, just a grey horizon
Hiding from heaven another frozen world

Watch the ship hold to its course
As an act of devotion
And me, I'm lost at sea
Going through the motions

Gave all my passion to the ocean
She holds it for me in reserve
My word is gone into remission
Your love's a tragedy that I don't deserve

She said, ""You're only growing now.""
She said, ""Soon have we begun, then she can have you
But until then, you're mine.""

I watch her hold to her course
As an act of devotion
And me, I'm riding high
Going through
Seems like every flash in her eye's
An act of devotion
And me I'm lost in her hands
Going through the motions

Shore far away off the bow
Shore far away off the starboard side

1795,Minnie Riperton,Memory Lane,relaxed,"[Verse 1]
I stumbled on this photograph, it kind of made me laugh
It took me way back, back down memory lane
I see the happiness, I see the pain
Where am I? Back down memory lane
I see us standing there, such a happy, happy pair
Love beyond compare, look a-there, look a-there

[Hook]
The way you held me
No one could tell me
That love would die

[Verse 2]
Why did I have to find this photograph? I thought I had forgot the past
Now I'm slipping fast, back down memory lane
I feel the happiness, I feel the pain
Here am I, back down memory lane
I'm in the sunshine, I'm in the rain
I thought it was over, here I go again

I don't wanna go
Travel up and down
Faster that the speed of sound
Back down memory lane
You steal my foolish heart
Don't let this feeling start

Save me, save me, save me, save me, save me, save me

1799,Steely Dan,Things I Miss The Most,relaxed,"I don't mind the quiet
Or the lonely nights
I don't miss the funky attitudes
And I don't miss the fights
I lie on the couch 'til suppertime
And hunker down and read the Post
And that's when I remember the things I miss the most:

The talk
The sex
Somebody to trust
The Audi TT
The house on the Vineyard
The house on the Gulf Coast
These are the things I miss the most

I kinda like frying up
My sad cuisine
Getting in bed and curling up with a girlie magazine
Sometimes in the corner of my eye
I see that adorable ghost
And then ba-boom I remember the things I miss the most

The talk
The sex
Somebody to trust
The comfy Eames chair
The good copper pans
The '54 Strat
These are the things I miss the most
I had a little birdy friend
By morning she was gone
Birdie good-bye
Birdie bye bye

I'm learning how to meditate
So far so good
I'm building the Andrea Doria out of balsa wood
The days really don't last forever
But it's getting pretty damn close
And that's when I remember the things I miss the most

The talk
The sex
Somebody to trust
The Audi TT

1800,J.B.O.,Walk with An Erection,happy,"Es war im Juli
Die Sonne stach und es hatte 30 Grad
Ich dachte mir, ooeeoo
Da geh' ich ins nächste Freibad
Ich geh' zum Kiosk
Und denk mir nix dabei, kaufe mir ein Eis
Doch was kommt da, ooeeoo
A 9er Frau und mir wird ganz heiß

Und schon kommt die Badehosenbeule
Eeooeeooeejeeooeeoo
Walk with an Erection

Schnell dreh ich mich um
Damit sie nicht meine Beule sehen kann
Doch was macht die Frau, ooeeoo
Sie lacht mich aus und ich lauf rot an
Ich kann nichts tun
Schließlich bin ich doch nur ein ganz normaler Mann
Die weiß ja net, ooeeoo
Wie schwer des is' mit vorn so was dran

Denn es ist gar nicht leicht mit der Beule
Eeooeeooeejeeooeeoooo
Walk with an Erection
Jetzt is' mir wurscht
Und es macht mir nix mehr aus, dass sie alle schau'n
Mit so ei'm Rohr, ooeeoo
Da klappt das verstecken wohl auch kaum
Er wird nicht kleiner
Ich weiß nicht, wie er lang das noch so weiter geht
Ich zeig ihn euch jetzt, ooeeoo
So lang er noch so schön steht
Ich geh' zum Fünf-Meter-Brett
Da sieht's jeder, und ich geh' hinauf
Doch ich bleib hängen, ooeeoo
Und es reißt mir die Badehose auf

Ich steh'im Freien und die Kinder schreien
Eeooeeooeejeeooeeoooo

1801,Leonard Cohen,Winter Lady,sad,"Trav'ling lady, stay awhile
Until the night is over
I'm just a station on your way
I know I am not your lover

Well I lived with a child of snow
When I was a soldier
And I fought every man for her
Until the nights grew colder

She used to wear her hair like you
Except when she was sleeping
And then she'd weave it on a loom
Of smoke and gold and breathing

And why are you so quiet now
Standing there in the doorway?
You chose your journey long before
You came upon this highway

Trav'ling lady, stay awhile
Until the night is over
I'm just a station on your way
I know I'm not your lover3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",folk/acoustic
1802,Zen Café,Vattupuskassa,sad,"Et noussut vuoteesta
Meni monta viikkoa
Harvoin paistoi ikkunasta sisään aurinko
Se oli syksyä
Muistan ettet sä
Hymyillyt, kun kannoin sänkys viereen lehtiä

Päivät mateli
Perin hitaasti
Pohjoistuuli puita harvensi
Sänkys vierellä
Leikin jänistä
Koitin pomppimalla saada sinut nauramaan

Kertosäe:
Vattupuskassa pidin piiloa
Toivoin, että jumalalta löytyis troppia
Suutuin koulussa, jumppatunnilla
Kun jätkät väitti, että isään nojaa kuolema

Lipputangossa ei ollut lippua
Vaikka täytit vuosia ja tuli vieraita
Äiti kampasi tukkas siistiksi
Pyysi vieraat pöydän ääreen syömään kakkua

Viikonloppuina ei käyty landella
Aalto pieksi laiturilta piirrustukset pois
Katsoin uutisia, kun sirkus finlandia
Päätti näytöskautensa aurooran kentällä

Toivoin, että pelko työntyis pois tai kauemmas

1803,Zac Brown Band,Chicken Fried,happy,"[Intro]
You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

[Verse 1]
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

[Chorus]
And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Verse 2]
It's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive, or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast
[Chorus]
To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

[Chorus]
Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
Get your little chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've done seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love28EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",country
1804,David Holmes,Gritty Shaker,happy,"I'm sittin' at a coffee table, unable to see straight
Watchin' parallel lines unwind and undulate
Behind the rain-streaked windowpane, the scene's bleak
Another train leavin' home
Conceding defeat with a low moan

Hangin' in a sky, made of stone
Everybody's leavin' home, I called my man Jerome
To come meet me in the twilight zone
Leave your mobile phone at home and come alone

I bought him coffee and a snack
Settled back, started speakin'
He was tweakin' with the peak of his cap
While I'm seekin' to discover what it takes to stay sober
Not cover my mistakes
Try to maybe make sense of the evidence
It's over, she's gone for good
Why should I lie, singin' a killer's lullaby
Identified by the dying ring of her goodbye
The last thing you hear before your life disappear

Now it just gets worse, like my stomach will burst
Feel like I've been cursed
With seven centuries of bitter memories
And inadequacies, previous he's and she's
I'm movin' round this old house for the last time
Scene of my past crimes, been here for lifetimes
Hearin' the chimes of the old clock that used to mock
You got eternity for takin' stock
This place is like a padlock
You look shocked
Trust me, nothing ever moves but the dust
There's just us and I'm here to torment and tease
And that's how it was for centuries
Me and my memories, till you brought the keys

Took the couple of Saturdays
I moved in runnin' from tragedies and boozing
Seven hundred years since I came here
You appear, same hair, same quizzical stare
I couldn't get near
And the sheer frustration was more than I could bear
I was really cursed, thought I'd been through the worst part

That was just the first part, just the start
Every night I'd be sitting with dread, breaking my heart
In case the man she'd been chasin' gets to first base
And I just can't escape, I'm in bad shape
You making love to someone else is more than I can take
And so I make all the movement I can to no avail
Scream and yell, sinkin' deeper into my personal Hell

I'm getting heated, I'm sorry, have another coffee
I needed to release my sparrow chest
From just a piece of this pressure
Unless an escape route is found
I'm going down underground
Into lifetimes of pain, it's absurd
The heaviest chain is contained is the sound of one word
So I'm referred back to Hell, huh
Just as well, I hate needles an' get twinges
At the thought of syringes
J, I'm going insane with shame
I dream and watch her makin' love over and over again
With what I call a farmer's swain
Unintelligent, pea-brained retard who's dick is always hard
Oh God, of course I'm jealous, fellows
Oversexed flexing his pec's
Jesus, what's he going make her do next?
I'm mad vex, the way she gently scratches his chest

You used to do that to me back in 1253
Pity me, while you lie with your lover
I stare and suffer in despair while you ruffle his hair
Unaware of who else is there
I move quick, I want to try my trick one last time
You know it's possible to vaguely define my outline
When dust move in the sunshine
So I'm tryin' to change, vibrate myself to near human pitch

Which reminds me how I used to come unstitched
And switch 'round the house in a blind rage
It took years and an ocean of tears
To find the key to this cage
And write another stage into a new age
It's difficult to gauge
But I know that I'll see you again, on that you may depend
I just don't know how or when
Sleep on, my lost love on goneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",dance/electronic

[Strophe 1]
Ich werde in die Tannen gehen
Dahin wo ich sie zuletzt gesehen
Doch der Abend wirft ein Tuch aufs Land
Und auf die Wege hinterm Waldesrand
Und der Wald er steht so schwarz und leer
Weh mir, oh weh, Und die Vögel singen nicht mehr

Ohne dich kann ich nicht sein, Ohne dich
Mit dir bin ich auch allein (Ohne dich)
Ohne dich zähl ich die Stunden ohne dich
Mit dir stehen die Sekunden, Lohnen nicht

Auf den Ästen in den Gräben
Ist es nun still und ohne Leben
Und das Atmen fällt mir ach so schwer
Weh mir, oh weh, und die Vögel singen nicht mehr

1806,The Little Willies,Lou Reed,happy,"We were drivin through West Texas
The land of beef and pork
Where they tend the hides of leather
We wear back in New York
In a pasture, along a roadside
Behind a brokedown shack
On a dusky side of evening
We saw a figure dressed in black

And we don't mean to sound like we're trippin
But we swear to God
We saw Lou Reed cow tippin
Cow tippin

Hey Lou, ""Is that you?""
She said as we pulled to the shoulder
He just said, ""Go screw.""
And then he turned and tipped one over
Under a spitshine Western sky
The color of blue varnish
Hey it's like Fellini
Actually I'm thinkin more like Jim Jarmusch

And we can't say how much we've been sippin
But we swear to God
We saw Lou Reed cow tippin
Cow tippin
I got cops on the cell
I said I got a little story to tell
Lou Reed is in the cow pen
They said, Oh no! Not again!

And we hope our perceptions isn't slippin
But we swear to God
We saw Lou Reed cow tippin
Cow tippin

Cow tippin
Cow tippin
Cow tippin
You really think that was Lou Reed?
Cow tippin
I'm sure it was, he was wearing black Levis
Cow tippin
I thought he was a vegetarian
Cow tippin
He's just tippin them over, he wasn't eating them

Hungry people don't stay hungry for long
They get hope from fire and smoke as the weak grow strong
Hungry people don't stay hungry for long
They get hope from fire and smoke as they reach for the dawn
The spirit of Jackson now screams through the ruins
Through factory chains and the ghost of the Union
The forgotten remains disappear to their new homes
The knife, the thrust, the life burns to the raw bone
The blood on the floor of the tear is still dryin'
Cover the spread sheets, the Dow Jones skyin'
The cell block live stock, the bodies they buyin'
Old south order, new northern horizon!

Peering into the eyes of the child already on trial
These armies rippin' families apart, get 'em on file
Convictions fit the stock profile all the while
Films of dogs, cuttin' through homes
Ripping skin from bones, yes, the new millennium homes
Privatizing through private eyes, an era rising
Of the old south order, new northern horizon

In the longest year that had me down
And I would freeze if you ever asked me
That was my way

Confront the guilt and try to overcome
Do not go away
I'm not there yet [x2]

I can see fire
When I fall behind (fall behind)
When I give up
My thoughts redefined
How cold is the flame
Of our uncompromising future
How cold is the sun

The city lights are fading still
The coming sky so white
And I'm the dark of this our new day
This is my way

Find the one
This weight will hold me down

Summer's hot and love is old
I wish I was smaller

There's lovers' sin in this town
Lovers cannot lay down
The summer's hot as hell here you know
If we think we can drink now
We won't stop 'cause we don't know how
It's cold, but we love
How it feels so right

I sweat it all out, you sweat a lot too
We hurt the same, the same black and blue
Oh, I wanna catch my death of cold
Oh, 'cause I'm scared I'm growing old
Oh, don't return the love I gave
Oh, you're still my favorite

Troubles win in this town
Troubles don't turn upside down
They shit on the last bit of fun

There's sin all around
Lovers cannot lay down
And the winter wears and tears
Our bones
There's a man in this town
He's shooting us down
He thinks he's a big man but he doesn't know anything about us or anything at all

At night he lies awake
And his heart aches
'cause it's cold
He sweats it out all the night through
Then he throws up all over me and you

Oh, you son of a bitches
(Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya)
It gets so fuckin' crabby in this booth, man
Shit is a hundred degrees in here
(Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya)
Smells like Satan's toilet

[Chorus]
I'm gonna build

[Verse 1]
Spilling the leftovers of creational clay
We grew with the concept, now we're ready to go public
Today's a big day for the company
A big step for the little steppers who slept for years uncomfortably
Little man, little lady, cute little baby
Reach your hand out to the future of automated robotics
On display here for the first time in (enter year here)
At the World's Fair, but is it really?
Ladies and gentlemen, I propose that the market is sinking
Under the weight of the useless contraptions
Added to the shopping carts of all hard-working families
Electric doodads and whizzer apps and such to keep the munchkins entertained
But get replaced by newer versions or just break down systematically
Mothers, how many times have you debated self-euthanasia tablets for breakfast snacks
When restlessness attacks, seemingly at random?
Feel an emptiness inside that's hard to identify, maybe?
Pursuing hobbies like pill-popping or constant overeating?
Chances are you've been abandoned
Now, I'm no scientist (No, no, no, no, no)
That's not what I went to school for
And I'm not a doctor
So I don't know much about medicine
But I'm willing to bet that you, yes, you, little
What's your name, sweetheart?
(Wah wah) Yeah, whatever
Get a funny feeling in your tummy when you see mommy cry
Something between woozy and confusion
And you spend your thoughts on how this sadness
In your mommy can be rooted out, burned, scorned, turned out, forgotten
So you can concentrate on candy and little baby dolls or
Whatever it is that normal kids get to think about
Well, I can honestly say that this invention is
Let me start by saying we've grafted only the finest of
Inserted the most high-tech
State of the art with brain charted from authentic
True-to-human emotions and trained to be domestic
Made from the most easily available materials and, uh, loosely inspected
Guaranteed to revolutionize
Perfectly realistic and even somewhat institutionally respected
Robotic relative
[Chorus]
That's why I'm gonna build
(A stepfather factory)
The latest in technology
(A stepfather factory)
Jobs for the community
(A stepfather factory)
The age of familial industry
(A stepfather factory)
Building tomorrow's fathers today

I'm not only the president, I'm a client

[Verse 2]
So you've purchased a paternal unit, class A, type 1
The new addition to your living room space, watch it go
Under warranty for at least ninety days, so have fun
If, in that time frame, there's a problem, please let us know
Before you start, there's a few details that you must learn
Technical specs about your unit to make things run smooth
In an effort to find an energy source our company's learned
The cheapest way to keep his battery running is with booze
Plug it in, give it a name, man of the house, self-sustained
Wearin' the pants, you can relax, one of the pack, nuclear fam
Literally nuclear
Which brings us to the safety chapter
Section eighty-seven in your handbook, subsection sixteen
Entitled ""Troubleshooting""
""Fuel sources are at a slight risk of mixing
With the crispy plutonium center
Of your automated new spouse and then dripping
Possibly leading to the unpredicted stimulation of its artificial emotion circuits
And in a few unsubstantiated clinical trials
This condition has led to simulating feelings of resentment and worthlessness
Manifested in the highly unlikely but still possible act
Of physical aggression towards you and your loved ones fleshy surfaces""

I feel like I wanna smack somebody
Turn around and bitch slap somebody
But I ain't goin' out bro (no, no, no)
I ain't givin' into it (no, no, no)
Anxieties bash my mind in
Terrorizing my soul like Bin Laden
But I ain't fallin' down bro (no, no, no)
I won't lose control bro (no, no, no)
Shackle and chained
My soul feels stained
I can't explain got an itch on my brain
Lately my whole aim is to maintain
And regain control of my mainframe
My bloods boiling its beatin' out propane
My train of thoughts more like a runaway train
I'm in a fast car drivin' in a fast lane
In the rain and I'm might just hydroplane

[Hook]
I don't fear none of my enemies
And I don't fear bullets from Uzi's
I've been dealing with something that's worse than these
That'll make you fall to your knees and that's
The anxiety
The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord, please, please, please
Take away my anxiety
[Verse 2]
My head keeps running away my brother
The only thing making me stay my brother
But I won't give into it bro (no, no, no)
Gotta get myself back now
God, I can't let my mind be
Tell my enemy is my own
Gots to find my inner wealth
Gots to hold up my thoughts
I can't get caught (no, no, no)
I can't give into it now (no, no, no)
Emotions are trapped set on lock
Got my brain stuck goin through the motions
Only I know what's up
I'm filled up with pain
Tryin' to gain my sanity
Everywhere I turn it's a dead end in front of me
With nowhere to go gotta shake this anxiety
Got me feelin' strange paranoia took over me
And its weighin' me down
And I can't run any longer, yo
Knees to the ground

I don't fear none of my enemies
And I don't fear bullets from Uzi's
I've been dealing with something that's worse than these

Been around the whole world
Still ain't seen nothing like my neighborhood
Out of all of the fancy satin and silk
My white cotton feels so good
Searched high and low for a place
Where I can lay my burdens down
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world

That you're gonna be a little late
Pure as a kiss on the cheek and a word

Singing to me happy birthday
When you quest for fortune and fame
Don't forget about the simple things

Lost sight of my goals

Not for the glitter and gold
Got everything that I prayed for
Even a little more

I still can hear them screaming

And the stars shine in silence
The Magic of the woods
Fly across the sad trees...
Is time to dream forever...
In the night of silver tears...

In the distance
You voice will be listen
Rise your eyes
To the faeryland realm

Is time to sing...in the land of dreams...

Dance in the woods
Under the mistical moon
Feel the embrace
Of the mother earth...

Is time to sing...in the land of dreams...
Is time to cry...for the lost innocence...

Beyond the old forest
A magic secret garden
Live enchanted
For you
Look at the mirror of your heart
And walk behind the gates
Of the eternal morning...

When asked why, a top law official adds, 'Because they make good game'""

Peace? Hahaha, don't make me laugh!
All I hear is motherfuckers rappin' succotash
Livin' large, tellin' me to get out the gang
I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigga
How the fuck do you figure
That I can say ""Peace"" and the gunshots will cease?
Every cop killer goes ignored
They just send another nigga to the morgue
A point scored, they could give a fuck about us
They rather catch us with guns and white powder
If I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me
Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy
They kill ten of me to get the job correct
To serve, protect, and break a nigga's neck
Cuz I'm the one with the trunk of funk
And ""Fuck tha Police"" in the tape deck
You should listen to me cuz there's more to see
Call my neighborhood a ghetto cuz it houses minorities
The other color don't know you can run but not hide
These are tales from the darkside

All of us are endangered, damn!

You wanna free Africa? I'll stare at ya
Cuz we ain't got it too good in America
I can't fuck with them overseas
My homeboy died over keys
Of cocaine, it was plain and simple
The 9mm went (buck) to the temple
(Buck, buck, buck) was the sound I put the bitch down
And ran to the schoolyard bathroom
Looked in the trash can, yo it had room
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute
Covered with trash I had to lay back
Mad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback
Tonight the crew gonna have a little fun
I went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun
It's gettin' critical - I stole a 5.0
I let it go - drive real slow
I yelled out ""Ice Cube, sucka""
The shotgun kicked, and it murdered motherfuckers
I told you last album
""When I got a sawed-off, bodies are hauled off""
Its a shame, that niggas die young
But to the light side it don't matter none
It'll be a drive by homicide
But to me its just another tale from the darkside
[Segue: Sampled guitar riff]
[Verse 3: Chuck D]
Standing in the middle of war, the minute we flex
When we die, we won't make Jet
Ebony can't see to the light side
The term they apply to us is a nigga
Call it what you want, cause I'm comin’ from the corner
Same applies to a Ph.D
Who's black - don't wanna roll - sells his soul
Watch his head go rollin’
Who the fuck are they foolin’?
Nobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes
Matches the color of the one on my face
As they wonder whats under my waist
(Standin' on the verge) of them gettin’ brown
That's a fact, got a fear of the bozack
Run, run, run, their ass off, they can not hide

Victims of society
Can't you see they're after you and me

Read in the paper, see it on the news
Law and disorder is all the media choose
Only show the hooligans, only show the thugs
Makes for better telly, makes us look mugsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",metal
1835,Blur,Sunday Sunday,happy,"[Verse 1]
Sunday, Sunday, here again in tidy attire
You read the colour supplement, the TV guide
You dream of protein on a plate
Regret you left it quite so late
To gather the family around the table
To eat enough to sleep
Oh, the Sunday sleep

[Verse 2]
Sunday, Sunday, here again, a walk in the park
You meet an old soldier and talk of the past
He fought for us in two World Wars
Says the England he knew is now no more
He sings the Songs of Praise every week
But always falls asleep
For a Sunday sleep, but he knows what he knows

[Bridge]
Sunday, Sunday
La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la

Oh, the Sunday sleep
[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Sunday, Sunday, here again in tidy attire
You read the colour supplement, the TV guide
You dream of protein on a plate
Regret you left it quite so late
To gather the family around the table
To eat enough to sleep
And Mother's pride's your epithet
That extra slice you'll soon regret
So going out is your best bet
Then bingo yourself to sleep
Oh, that Sunday sleepEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock
1836,Telepathe,So Fine,happy,"Pusher be the test and I beat to the rest
In my head, in my head now
Slow candle burning with your flame on high and now I'm dry land so
Play it bland, play it bland
The sound of escape now honey
Take it take it
Say it lover, say it lover right
It's all the faker, the light hearted taker
So take it, so take it, so take it

Dream is in this heart
Season in these years
Death is in this heart

So what so what
So fine so fine

Sad that you can’t hear

It always ends up to one thing, honey
When I look and you’re not there

Each night and day, I pray in hope that I might find you
In hope that I might find you, because heart’s can do no more

It always ends up to one thing honey
Still I kneel upon the floor

The frost christens every car that drives by with ice
And then I know
Those old black and white movies were true

A slow taxi through the twinkling glitz
Takes us past the megastores
The whores, the poor, the rich in the Ritz
Then I know
Those old black and white movies were true

Is there enough change in your pocket
For another gin and tonic?
And a moment when the conscience explodes
The snow upon the bonnet
The picture
The song
The sonnet
The morning light as she puts on her clothes

The steps up out of the subway to the cold
Your cute face, dumb hat, runny nose

Puis on est pas venu là dans un monastère
Ni casser la voix mais pour péter les artères »

1853,Jean Grae,My Story,sad,"[Verse 1: Jean Grae]
“If I could swim a thousand lakes to bring your life back...”  I write
That, but infinity can’t rewind facts.  You are
Divinity.  My primitive mind was struggling
Just to understand the meaning of life, forgive me
I never told my mommy, I couldn’t break her spirit.  She always
Wished her daughter extraordinary thinking, so I
Traveled alone, young, sixteen, got in
The habit of not staying at home, doing the
Sad walk like Bill Bixby, a dollar fifty
Trips to the hospital so that Medicaid could fix me
I couldn’t eat shit.  I fainted frequent
On cold floors and I pause and I think, “Keep it”
I’m lost.  My four friends know and just
Fuck at the boys’ apartments for rent, so I’m all
Wishing that it’s a dream ending soon.  I’ve actually
Erased a lot that I’ve been through

[Hook: Jean Grae]
See, when
The rain comes down
I know it’s falling for me
And only for me
And when
The pain comes around, there’s nowhere
Else I rather would be
I know what I’ve done (Please forgive me)
[Verse 2: Jean Grae]
Now all my bitter homies saying, “That’s what men do.”  Feeling
Retarded for seeing partner potential.  On top
Of that, the doctors telling me a heart murmur.  I can’t
Take it, I’m contemplating a Glock burner, a
Cop murderer.  I can’t leave.  This can’t be
The tears streaming, and I can’t see they lanced me
And I’m passing out, and this is just for blood.  They had
To cover the mass amounts.  I’ve had enough
And you don’t know what it’s like in waiting rooms, and out-
-side, their picketing pictures could slay you
They’re screaming, “Victims,” and spitting ‘til they shame you
I hold my head low and shiver, push my way through
They put you in a room where you can change into
Your gown and shower cap, shaking as a fiend would do
And that’s when you think of leaving, fleeing the building
And then they call you and you’re hearing the call of your children
They count down from ten now.  You wanna stop ‘em, but
You say it in your head: you’re out for the cut
And then you wake up in another room with plenty others
They call it recovery.  You’re thinking, “We ain’t mothers”
And then prescription pills, written a ‘script with chills
An understatement.  You’re dressed but you’re naked still
And your brain won’t think straight
Wait.  Can’t finish this
[Hook: Jean Grae]
See, when
The rain comes down
I know it’s falling for me
And only for me
And when
The pain comes around, there’s nowhere
Else I rather would be
I know what I’ve done (Please forgive me)

[Verse 3: Jean Grae]
I kept it bottled up.  My parents found the pills
Screaming, “God what have you done?”  Cried ‘til I snotted blood
Then got a gun.  My temple ran quick though
From the thought, then the worst: I was caught in the same place
A year later.  For me, that’s when hatred started
My faith martyred.  I’ve dated the father of a father
Then I moved on.  Years passed, the guilt’s
Worse and it builds ‘til your heart’s smashed
Then I miscarried.  Twenty-two age, I was headed to
A breakdown, swallowed up some pills and I laid down
I was a failure at that too, bailed from
The rap then, but fate took me back in
“Sing” is a tattoo my fingers attached with.  Twenty-seven
With three kids that I never met.  What if I
Was Catholic?  Wonder if they hate me, thinking how
Their mother could ever murder?  Well take me, Hell
To the depths where the brimstone chokes me constantly
I am a monster, see.  How could I possibly
Correspond with God when I gave the authority
To end their life?
But it’s never over, even if we have a child
They could have had a brother or a sister or both
I’m thinking about another life that almost got close
Praying that, in another time, we could have changed posts
If I could just reverse time, I would
I don’t know what I would do.  Honestly, it’s not good
I’m sorry...4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",hip hop

1855,Todd Rundgren,Song of the Viking,happy,"I am a Viking of some note
Knut's my name and here I float
Out on the sea in a great big boat
And I'm the one who beats the drum in time

To stroke the oars that drive our galleons on
And while we rowed we had our song
And we had our god and it may seem odd
But at least there was a cause

Caught a wind and we upped the sail
Lost two ships when it turned to a gale
Down went a third when she rammed on a whale
Though we despaired we could not fail
And through it all we never faltered

Late at night I lay on deck
Wondering why I risk my neck
Picture myself in a sinking wreck
And down I'm going not knowing why
I just can't quite recall the reason why

It's such a drag to carry on
But there was a cause, but there was a cause
Still there was a reason, reason
If you like I'll be your Viking
Sit you down to a Nordic meal
Give you strength that you might wield
The Viking sword and the Viking shield
And off we'll sail in mighty ships of yore
Perhaps we shouldn't let our hands get sore

We need someone to pull the oars
And to do the chores
So we need a cause
We need a reason, reason whyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",rock

I don't want no candy
I don't need no toy
I took a stick and an old coffee can
I bang on that thing 'til I got
Blisters on my hand because

1857,Hagalaz' Runedance,Serenade of The Last Wolf,sad,"He runs into the night
Finding a place to hide;
Why do they hunt him again?

His heart, it beats so fast;
No sound, they moved on at last
Timidly he wanders his way

The outcast, he enters their town
Senseless hate haunts him now;
The outcast with more feeling then they'll ever know

He only came for some food
Maybe even company;
Sometimes he feels so alone

He is the last one of his kind
All his companions have died;
Man signed their fatal destiny

His dreams tell him of ancient times
Of wolves and men running side by side;
How delightful freedom must have been

Wild woman's mate and totem-beast
Idolized he was, but suddenly all changed;
When the men with false dogmas came
You call him the evil beast?
But you are the real evil beast!
You, who damned nature's dearest child

He cries his sorrow to the moon
A tear shines through the misty gloom
Can't you hear the last wolf's serenade?

They came wild and free
Life in it's livery
Stealing life from the land's living

Alone he sits by the lake
His image in the lake his only friend
Can't you hear the last wolf's serenade?

Can't you hear the last wolf's serenade?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",folk/acoustic
1858,Dead Kennedys,One-Way Ticket to Pluto,angry,"Countdown, get ready for the blast off
And don't forget the hype, we're going into space
Distinguished scientists, a pesky senator and monkey turds leaking from the lab
All brought to us play by play by Howard Cosell

You're going where no man has gone before
Don't ask us where that is, we have no idea
You're chosen for this great mission because we owe you some favors
And besides, you're bright, a little too bright

Step one, senator, your vomit
It's time to analyze it for the folks back home
Open the hatch, launch the war satellite that the commies aren't supposed to know about
Our real challenge is to keep it a secret from the press back home

You're going where no man has gone before
Don't ask us where that is, we have no idea
You're chosen for this great mission because you're healthy and strong and make a lot of fuss
Especially around us, we like you better when you're far away

Have you noticed you're going the wrong direction?
We have but that's your problem, we planned it that way
We had to dispose of all of you so we can spoil the final frontier
How dare you question our Star Wars plans for the farce that they are?

You're going where no man has gone before
For rocking the boat in our temple of doom
You're on a one-way ticket to Pluto, we wash our hands of you and your lost ark

1860,Gil Scott-Heron,Whitey On The Moon,angry,"We have a poem here, it's called ""Whitey On The Moon""
It was inspired by some whiteys on the moon
So I wanna give credit where credit is due
A rat done bit my sister Nell
With whitey on the moon
Her face and arms began to swell
And whitey's on the moon
I can't pay no doctor bills
But whitey's on the moon
Ten years from now I'll be payin' still
While whitey's on the moon
The man just upped my rent last night
Cause whitey's on the moon
No hot water, no toilets, no lights
But whitey's on the moon
I wonder why he's upping me?
Cause whitey's on the moon?
Well I was already giving him fifty a week
With whitey on the moon
Taxes taking my whole damn check
Junkies making me a nervous wreck
The price of food is going up
And as if all that shit wasn't enough:
A rat done bit my sister Nell
With whitey on the moon
Her face and arm began to swell
And whitey's on the moon
Was all that money I made last year
For whitey on the moon?
How come I ain't got no money here?
Hmm! Whitey's on the moon
Y'know I just 'bout had my fill
Of whitey on the moon
I think I'll send these doctor bills

From a president derailed

That I can't think for myself
Blame it all on someone else
Half-hearted smile
While you look the other way

The bright light of your star confronts me shining through

Whirlpools rage on constantly, I'm not so well these days
There must be something somewhere near
Who sees what's being done

And to my ears her beauty bring
Like Maddox in the days of old

And folding still we'll spare a thought
For what's been lost and what's been caught
And maybe then begin again
For love is life, not poison

Away from you
The bright light of your star confronts me
Shining through

1874,Timo Rautiainen & Trio Niskalaukaus,Lintu,sad,"[Verse 1]
Tuskin tunnen häntä ja kuitenkin
Tulin häntä tapaamaan
Hän on niin kovin kaunis vieläkin
Kun kääntyy minua katsomaan

Tämä yö on minulle viimeinen
Kuulen hänen sanovan
Olen sairas ja väsynyt ihminen
Ja siksi lähteä haluan

[Chorus 1]
Sinä tiedät jo jotakin elämästä
Jotain tiedän minäkin
Kun vain uskallat lakata pelkäämästä
Paratiisin saat takaisin

[Verse 2]
Hän vielä jatkaa kyynelet silmissään
Sanaa jokaista painottaen
Hän pitää kättäni tiukasti kädessään
Ja sanoo silmiin katsoen:

En kadu ketään niistä, joita syliini suljin
Heitä sentään rakastin
Itken kaikkia niitä
Joiden ohitse kuljin
Joita väistin ja pakenin
[Chorus 2]
Sillä aina kun ihmisen lähelle päästin
Löysin lähelle itsekin
Mutta jos itseäni varjelin ja säästelin
Heti eksyin ja palelin

[Verse 3]
Hänen katseensa sammuu, hän huokaisee
Hänen otteensa raukeaa
Siinä samassa silmiä häikäisee
Ja huoneen ikkuna aukeaa

Kun jälleen katson häntä, hän muuttunut
Onkin linnuksi edessäin
Ja linnun siipeä puhtaan valkoista
Minä pidänkin kädessäin

[Chorus 3]
Lintu nousee ja lentoon jo lehahtaa
Minä paikalle yksin jään
Hahmo taivaan korkeuksiin loittoaa
Huone humisee tyhjyyttään

[Vese 4]
Istun hiljaa vielä ja muistelen
Hänen viime sanojaan
Niitä puoliääneen toistelen
Kun hän on mennyt menojaan:
En kadu ketään niistä, joita syliini suljin
Heitä sentään rakastin
Itken kaikkia niitä, joiden ohitse kuljin
Joita väistin ja pakenin

[Chorus 2]
Sillä aina kun ihmisen lähelle päästin
Löysin lähelle itsekin
Mutta jos itseäni varjelin ja säästelin

1875,Ensiferum,Slayer Of Light,angry,"I have come to unfold your mind
In my veins runs the poison wild
In the streams of mountains I flow
I have opened the doors for unleashed and endless hate
It will burn like the raging green flames
Inside a man dwell secrets so cold

Through the dreadful storms, across the frozen oceans
I have come from the dark lands with sorrow in my hands
The firewind rages in the sky
And my luminous sword hungers for more
I will leave no one alive
For I am the Slayer of Light

I... I will break your will
I... I will crush your faith
I... I will slay your dreams
I will reclaim the stars and I will tear your precious world apart
I will tear it apart

I will pull everything with me under the surface
And all the screams will fade into my dreams
Fall now! Dying light!
I will burn away the ground beneath your feet
And all will be vanished in the darkness
Dying light! Fall now!

Just hurts like hell
Leaving is my only choice
Will you cry for me?

'Cause all of the men that looked in your eyes
And all of the boys that lie at your feet
Forget how to breathe, forget how to speak
And all of them want you tonight
So hold me tight

Are you still around me, my friends

For no one cares

To state that my young eyelids just turned to grey

Sag mir was ist bloß um uns geschehn

Wenn ich in deinen Armen liege
Ist es egal geworden was mit uns passiert

Wollten wir nich alles wagen haben wir uns vielleicht verraten

Es gibt nichts mehr zu reden denn wenn es regnet
Ist es besser aufzugeben

I never used to snore in my sleep 'til this rap shit started
Warm thoughts fill the hot-headed and cold-hearted
Your whole paycheck, you burp it and then fart it
And y'all think I'm gon' stop? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
In one year I got rich, now life's movin so fast
But bein broke with no food is just a thing of the past
Plus I'm the new phenomenon like white women with ass
And y'all prayin that I flop? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
In New York I buy clothing, in Cali I get green
In Atlanta I get sleep, in Texas I sip lean
All these rappers wanna know what I'm gettin for sixteens
Try 80, want a discount? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
See in just six months I infiltrated the system
If you find somebody better, then I'm sorry I missed him
Niggas hate givin me props cause I might use it against them
C'mon, get Ludacris out! BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!

If you mad I'm on top, then wish me gone
If you mad I'm on the road, then wish me home
And if you mad that I'm right, punk wish me wrong

It's time to saddle up the Tontos cause I'm the Lone Ranger
I eat dinner with Jews but don't talk to strangers
I'm just a few albums from filling your disc changer
If you ever think of stoppin me - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
I'm a hustler by nature but criminal by law
Any charges set against me, chunk it up and stand tall
Next year I'm lookin into buyin Greenbriar Mall
You probably own a lot of property! BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
C'mon and take a look, he's got gigantic balls
Plus his money keeps flowin like Niagara Falls
We all know Jesus saves and Ludacris withdraws
I'm 'bout to go on vacation - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
Shout out to Bill O'Reilly, I'mma throw you a curve
You mad cause I'm a THIEF and got away with words
I'mma start my own beverage, it'll calm your nerves

And Latinos always waitin for my CD's to drop
White people love the flow, they say, ""Dude, you fuckin rock!""
Yo' fans are my fans, right? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
So find my album in the stores and look for the white steam
Rip it open, play it and yo' momma might scream
It's hard, other albums are softer than ice cream
Yo' scans are my scans, right? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
Now Luda's throwin up A's, and I'm lightin up L's
Around the globe gettin paid, you home bitin yo' nails

We probably gettin on your nerves, huh? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!

So we journeyed to her house one thing led to another

Posse in effect, hangin' out is always hype
And when me and the crew leave the shindig I want a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame, I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss cold gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jock she was like static cling
But that's what happens when bodies start slappin' from doin' the wild thing

[Hook]
Wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing
Please baby baby please
Wild thing

[Verse 4]
Doin' a little show at the local discotheque
This fine young chick was on my jock so I say what the heck
She wanted to come on stage and do her little dance
So I said chill for now but maybe later you'll get your chance
So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said, ""Tone, let me tell you one thing
I need $50 to make you holler, I get paid to do the wild thing""
[Outro]
Say what?
Yo love, you must be kidding
You're walkin' babe
Just break out of here
Hasta la vista, baby

1898,Dierks Bentley,What Was I Thinkin',happy,"[Verse 1]
Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinking?
She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out waving that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinking?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

[Chorus]
Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where the night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking

[Verse 2]
By the county line the cops were nipping on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinking?
Out the other side she was hollering faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blasting
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancing
What was I thinking?
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

[Chorus]
Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where the night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking

[Verse 3]
When a mountain of a man with a ""born to kill"" tattoo
Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hood-sliding like Bo Duke
What was I thinking?
I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddy's in a lawn chair sitting on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinking, oh what was I thinking, oh what was I thinking
Then she gave a come-and-get-me grin
And like a bullet we were gone again... cause I was

[Chorus]
Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where the night might lead
I know what I was feeling

Would you tell me I was wrong?
Would you help me understand?

I could never love you back
I could never care enough
In these last days

Found me well on her words
I don't know what to do or say

Warm canals and pools clear blue
The Tuscarawas flowed into
The Great Lakes

Ridin' back
Where the highway met dead tracks
The ground is now cement and glass
So far away

What about the sweetness we knew?
What about what's good, what's true
From those days?

I could never love you back
I could never care enough

Gather round the home she rests
So pull and go over there Midwest

My open eyes to lightnin' storm
The touch of mist felt soft, felt warm
On my face

A million miles ago you seem
A star that I just don't see

Words long gone
Lost on journeys we walked on
Lost are voices heard along

Never feelin' love like that

I found myself immediately intrigued by him
It's almost like I knew this man from another life
Like back then maybe I was his husband maybe he was my wife
And even,things I don't like about him are fine with me

Submit to nothing and swallow my spit of scorn

I found a way to be by your side..
Through the ins and outs, the wrong and rights
After a while..of bein settled down I didn't know how
To keep the love, cuz i was young
I wish i knew then what I know now
I woudn't've let you go I swear I would've made this love grow

Tryin to match what we had and now I...

I was hopin' we could find a way
To have what we had again today
Though it's been some time since you and I...
It wouldn't hurt to try
To find our love

Wish that I, would have known the treasures I'd found
I didn't know, until you left, I loved your smile..
Just the other day, your girl said you can't stand me...
I know you don't mean that can't we
Just slow down a minute and talk it out
I've been, in my share, of love since then
Don't know about, what you've been through
But nothin compares..to
What we had
All I know is I need you back
And i know that you need me back
Baby let's try again to find our love ohh

Not just walk through

Unpack your bag

Come home
Don't leave here with all these thoughts inside my head

Don't leave here with all these thoughts inside my head

Rewind the lines and find the hidden meanings
Ten more screenings
Of our last fight
Sitting alone and knowing that I need you
As I remember
Our first fight

1924,Titus Andronicus,Arms Against Atrophy,angry,"A band trip dance - what could be the harm
But a six week vacation from the use of my right arm
It was just the two hits I remember nothing more
Only Alex hitting the switch and me hitting the floor
We're taking this lying down
The one thing I can stand up for is resting supine on the ground
Mr. McDermott, won't you help me to my feet
Because the drumline's going wild in the San Francisco streets
The long walk home, is an hour and a half
But it quickly turns to three or four with stops at every underpass
But by June 22nd, I have done the math
That's a hundred and five liters I'll consume of Dr. Path
Some girls will tell their secrets to anyone
The word ""love"" gets thrown around a lot near graduation
So please don't whisper sweet nothings in my ear
When the sound of shredding vocal chords is what I want to hear
Because we're going to San Francisco and I forget to wear some flowers in my hair
She's got a secret surname that nobody knows with the most gorgeous hyphen
You wouldn't believe the way it glows
And I'm the only one who gets to see it way up close
So the rest of you can stick it up your nose
Last night, I had the strangest dream that I have ever known
My mother, in a fit of rage, chases me from our home
My mother, the murderer holds me down in the road
She's got the nail clippers at my throat
Even though things lately may have been real horror-show
I'm wishing I was back in-utero
I'd like to go back to the way that things were before, but apparently
I'm looking at physical therapy
It won't be exactly how it used to be
It ain't hard to see that it's not that way
Not that way anymore
Jesus Christ is suffering upon his cross tonight
I just sit outside waiting for frost to bite
""It's always this way,"" she says on her way out the door
Wait and see
The rest is yet to reveal itself to meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",folk/acoustic

I couldn't see it for my head was too low
And prying eyes, they stoop too low
Poisoning my soul, as sanity waits in the gallows

Defeated I, fighting for a lost cause
Depleted I, dying for the wrong cause

These are the hours on the range
The more you show them
The more they choose to take away

Defeated I, fighting for a lost cause
Depleted I, dying for the wrong cause

Some things never change in the wings
And as it's your war
There'll be no escape at all

Sun-baked, slender heroine of film & magazine

You'll have all that you can eat of milk & honey over there
You'll be the brightest light the world has ever seen
The dizzy height of a jet-set life- you could never dream

Lips so sweet
Skin so fair
Your future bright
Beyond compare
It's rags to riches
Over there

So think about that when you plan on dissing, go straight to hell

Can't die over, must conquer the world first
Like a monster to media on my beautiful girls search

Made the plan you should cancel it, make examples I trample shit
Drop your hair I am cancerous, answer this, who can handle this?

1938,Nicole Atkins,Together We're Both Alone,relaxed,"I am raising a flag, I am just too tired now to fight
It's white and it's waving, can't we save this for another night?
I used to be afraid, but now I crave the quiet
Together we are both alone, but I don't mind
I'll dream of something to try and make us alright
To make us alright

Baby, put your arms down
They're machines that can't be fixed no more
'Cause when the alarm sounds
I'll be right here waiting at your door
We'll sit up on the bed for a while
Together we are both alone, but we don't mind
We'll dream of something to try and make us alright
To make us alright, it's alright, it's alright
To make us alright, it's alright, it's alright

But the dawn is trouble
When I close my eyes, you never go away
I've tried everything, still you won't change
Is it better if you go?

But the ending doesn't matter
One hundred days and then the suffering stops
Running faster through this
Hope to save your heart before it drops
And you can never say I didn't try
Together we are both alone, but I don't mind
I dreamt of everything, I tried to make us alright
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right

And she lays down her head on your pillow at night

Into despite, out of control

In-decision
Mercenary venture blast
In to despite control

Hypocrisy in-tolerance
All ways go down
Go down
Come here to face me
Displaying the anger
The blueprints of hate

These are blueprints of hate

So full of agony inside

In deep silhouette
You're tired of racing
You're down and I said

I'll wait, back here
A cold end, an evening

A soaked cigarette
I'm asleep on a shoulder that I've never met
I'll wait back here
Or should I, start pushing my way back
Yeah
Should I start pushing my way
Home

Cold, and the whiskey is wearing
And I'm on the edge of my breath
Oh
And I'm thinking of leaving
I could just lay down
Lay down and freeze to death

Hey yeha yeha
Oh, hold on
Yeah

Hey yeah yeah
Oh, hold on

A cold Winter sun
My feet underground
A pale Winter city
A numbness for soundEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",pop
1957,Alison Krauss,Ghost in This House,sad,"I don't pick up the mail
I don't pick up the phone
I don't answer the door
I'd just as soon be alone
I don't keep this place up
I just keep the lights down
I don't live in these rooms
I just rattle around

I'm just a ghost in this house
I'm just a shadow upon these walls
As quietly as a mouse I haunt these halls
I'm just a whisper of smoke
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire
That once burned out of control
You took my body and soul
I'm just a ghost in this house

I don't care if it rains
I don't care if it's clear
I don't mind staying in
There's another ghost here
He sits down in your chair
And he shines with your light
And he lays down his head
On your pillow at night
I'm just a ghost in this house
I'm just a shadow upon these walls
I'm living proof of the damage
Heartbreak does
I'm just a whisper of smoke
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire
That once burned out of control
And took my body and soul
I'm just a ghost in this house

1958,Richard Hell & the Voidoids,Love Comes in Spurts,angry,"I was a child
Who wanted love that was wild
Though tight as slow motion
But crazed with devotion

Insane with devotion
A whole other notion
I was fourteen and a half
And it wasn't no laugh

Love comes in spurts - oh no it hurts
Love comes in spurts - it hurts
Love comes in spurts - oh no, cause
Love comes in spurts - it always hurts

I just can't get wise
To those tragical lies
Though I now know the facts
They still cut like an axe

Cause love comes in spurts
In dangerous flirts
And it murders your heart
They didn't tell you that part

Love comes in spurts
Love comes in spurts
Love comes in spurts
Love comes in spurts
Love comes in spurts

1960,Triumph the Insult Comic Dog,I Keed (Album Version),happy,"I thought my CD was done
But that's not what they say
""Do an insult track, we need it for radio play""
Cram in the names, I'll take a long hard pee
Time to mess up the biz like an MP3

American Idols, that's who I look for
In the poop section of my local record store
Ruben or Clay, oh which should I pick
It's like choosing which puddle of vomit to lick

And when I want something even more fruity and fake
I look up 'N' for N'Sync or 'T' for Timberlake
So many skills Justin's making a buck at
Does he rap? Does he sing? He doesn't know what to suck at

Now as for the bitches, let's give Britney thanks
For the face that launched a million preteen skanks
You were a virgin, that had to be hard
You've had more bones in your mouth than a St. Bernard

I keed, I keed!
(He just make a little joke)
I joke with you!
(Little dog, little joke)
I keed, I keed!
(He just make a little joke)
Yeah, you're a great actress too
(Little dog, little joke)
Now let's go to Walmart where they won't sell my CD
That company's nuts are in a jar in aisle 3
But you can see Christina in all her sluthood
It's like watching porn but the music's not as good

I want to stuff my TV's crotch with a dollar
Still I'd hump you if I could wear my flea collar
You're looser than my poop after eating Honeydew
Only 50 Cent's been plugged more than you

And yet you're too old for Fred Durst to desire
He's checking out the cast of Lizzie McGuire
Soon Fred will try to get Mandy Moore
To open for him, and I don't mean on tour
You're not the first, Durst, poor R Kelly
His videos premiere at the L.A.P.D
I believe they set up an innocent guy
You know what else? I believe I can fly

I keed, I keed!
(He just make a little joke)
I joke with you!
(Little dog, little joke)
I keed, I keed!
(He just make a little joke)
I believe Michael too, yes
(Little dog, little joke)
Now look how fucking cool those guys from the Strokes are
Their riffs are three times as old as my jokes are
Hey White Stripes guy, is that your wife or your sister
Shouldn't you be playing country music, mister?

Hey Coldplay, maybe you should be Coldsore
Back when you were U2 I liked you so much more
Somehow your song ""Yellow"" reminds me of pee
I think cause when it's over, it's a big relief to me

Now Pink, is that your hair or a tattoo?
I didn't know Supercuts had a drive-thru
Yo Nelly, what kind of name is that?
That's about as gangsta as an Easter bonnet hat

And Snoop says he's clean now? You make the call
The guy's higher than Billy Joel's Cholesterol
Snoop, there's only room for one dog, putz
And I can rap, can you lick your own nuts?

Poop Diddy, are you in show business still?
I didn't know wearing a suit was a skill
J Lo, J Lo, the giant tail-o
For a doggy's nose, that's the Holy Grail-o

Shakira's butt's fine, but it won't hold still you see
I sniffed Elton John's tush just for all the history
I sniffed J-Lo's ass and got too touchy-feely
She let loose a bomb that was bigger than Gigli
I keed, I keed!
(He just make a little joke)
I joke with you
(Little dog, little joke)
I keed, I keed!
(Nothing wrong with your butt)
I even like...I don't like Affleck
(Nothing wrong with your butt)

Avril Lavigne punk queen, now there's a kidder
Go back north, Celine needs a baby-sitter
Philip Glass, atonal ass, you're not immune
Write a song with a fucking tune
And on the list of bitches don't leave off MTV
I scared them and Eminem so they gave the hook to me
Slim Shady, why do you find me so scary?
We're just two regular dudes who banged Mariah Cary
Wipe off that frown, just do without it
Hey my mom was a bitch too, but I don't go writing songs about it

I keed, I keed!

I want a girl who knows what's best
I want a girl with shoes that cut
And eyes that burn like cigarettes
I want a girl with the right allocations
Who's fast and thorough and sharp as a tack
She's playing with her jewelry, she's putting up her hair
She's touring the facility and picking up slack

I want a girl who gets up early (Gets up early)
I want a girl who stays up late (Stays up late)
I want a girl with uninterrupted prosperity (Uninterrupted)
Who uses a machete to cut through red tape
With fingernails that shine like justice
And a voice that is dark like tinted glass
She is fast, thorough, and sharp as a tack
She is touring the facility and picking up slack

[Chorus]
I want a girl with a short skirt and a long, long jacket

I want a girl with a smooth liquidation (Smooth liquidation)
I want a girl with good dividends (Good dividends)
At Citibank we will meet accidentally (Meet accidentally)
We'll start to talk when she borrows my pen
She wants a car with a cupholder armrest
She wants a car that will get her there
She's changing her name from Kitty to Karen
She's trading her MG for a white Chrysler Le Baron

Have captured our imagination, like vampires
What explains our enduring fascination with vampires?

What is it about the vampire myth that explains our interest?
Is it the overtones of sexual lust, power, control
Or is it a fascination with the immortality of the undead?

And what dark and hidden parts of our psyche are aroused
And captivated by the legends of the undead
By the legends of the undead, by the legends of the undead

The mysteries of the undead will continue to fascinate the living
The mysteries of the undead will continue to
Will continue to fascinate the living, vampires

Give me the joy of summer wine

I remember you and I start to smile
Even though now you don't want to know me
I get on by
And I go the extra mile

Ice of the heart melted away and found the light
These are the days of endless dreaming;
Troubles of life are floating away like a bird in flight
These are the days
These are the days
These are the days

Believin' that the tears would end for good
I told them that we'd get though any weather
Maybe that didn't work out, but we did the best we could

Don't you fucking pity me, get up, get off
What the hell am I saying? I don't know about malevolent
Sure as hell decadent, I want somebody to step up, step off

Get a grip, don't let me slip till I drop the ball

The writing on the wall
A Lazarus in parable

A dark and sullen lullaby
Whispered softly as you die
Promising torments are nigh

Danger warning levels hissed out loud
I saw the silver lining hidden in a mushroom cloud
Now I'm reeling from the shock at ground zero

If yesterday you would have stood up proud
Then why tonight have you thrown in with the stoning crowd?
I'll breathe through the foetus of a new day kicking...

The foetus of a new day kicking

It's true that Jesus cannot save
I'm rising from the grave
To put my double cross to shame

A poison rush, a heart attack
A white assassin painted black
You'll fear this reaper coming back
Danger warning levels hissed out loud
I saw the silver lining hidden in a mushroom cloud
Now I'm reeling from the shock at ground zero

If yesterday you would have stood up proud
Then why tonight have you thrown in with the stoning crowd?
I'll breathe through the foetus of a new day kicking...

On a night like this
You laid the serpent's kiss
In this garden of Gethsemane
You played the traitor well...

In a dawn to come
I will blind the sun
To grant you pardon as my enemy

Before damning you to hell...

Danger warning levels hissed out loud

1966,Animal Collective,Water Curses,happy,"To be the motion actor
Two broken strings attract her
A groom, a face, a light-filled room
Hesitate to throw a coin in, a wish could be a bad thing
My mouth is just a mesh of drool

I'm standing on the bridge
I won't get hit from up high
A talking fish comes as she moves
I want to be like water
And never need a doctor
And carve the earth without my tools
(To-oool!)

All the things that I relate to well like  goggles and paint tubes
Transparent paper wings that float above me while I sleep
To make the room more natural
To think I'm dying, an I'm dying, I'm dyin'

The color after sunset
You'd do anything to jinx it
It'll crush your skull just like a willow
He doesn't need a house
His shoes can walk for miles
There's the drips, the black spots on my pillow
I want to be like water and slip into your throat
And make you feel alive and good
I want to be like water and '
Never have a doubt
And crack the hoods around my pool
(Po-oool!)

All the things that I relate to well like goggles and paint tubes
Transparent paper wings that float above me while I sleep
To make the room more natural
To think I'm dying, an' I'm dying, I'm dyin'

And all the things I hate I wish I didn't have to hate

Having a Heineken falling asleep
She looks so sexy when she's walking to sand
Nobody ever put a ring on her hand

Swim to the oceanshore fishing the sea
She is the story, the story is she
She sings to the moon and the stars in the sky
Shining from high above you shouldn't ask why

She is the one that you'll never forget
She is the heaven sent angel you met
Oh she must be the reason why god made a girl
She is so pretty all over the world

She puts the rythm, the beat in the drum
She comes in the morning, in the evening she's gone
Every little hour, every second you live
Trust in eternity, that's what she gives

She looks like Marilyn, walks like Susanne
She talks like Monica and Mary-Ann
She wins in everything that she might do
And she will respect you, forever just you

She is the one that you'll never forget

Oh she must be the reason why god made a girl

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this old rap shit, he
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

Taking all you need

You're the love of my life
But it cuts like a knife
And I feel that I'm being misled
See, I'm a little concerned
For I've recently learned
Of the swastika tattoo on your head

And it makes you smile
When you hear ""Sieg Heil""
You love the smell of a burning cross in the yard
You do goose-step salutes
In your Doc Martin boots
And you quoted ""Mein Kampf"" in our 5th anniversary card

I think you're a nazi, baby
Are you a nazi?
You might be a nazi, baby...

You keep extensive files
On the Nuremberg trials
And you watch them whenever they're airing
I guess I should've known
When you bought a new bone
For your puppies named Göbbles and Göring
You showed up late
To our very first date;
I said, ""How are you?"", you said, ""White power""
Call me paranoid
But I'm not overjoyed
When you ask me if I want to shower...

I think you're a nazi
Don't be lyin', baby
Are you a nazi?
Are you anti-Zion, baby?

Your every dress
Is monagrammed ""SS""
You hold an Aryan picknick and bash
And it makes me irate
When you say I look great
When I wear a little tiny moustache

Your social politics
Say that races don't mix
And you call it pure-blood pollution
And whenever I'm sad
You say it's not so bad
For every problem there's a Final Solution...
I think you're a nazi
Give me an answer, baby
Are you a nazi?
You drive a fuckin' panzer, baby

You say that love is blind
So how could I have guessed...
But then again, I met you
At the Wagner Fest...

I know you're a nazi
And that's why I'm leavin'
I know you're a nazi

'Cause I know what's ailing me

All I need is my baby
You don't know I'm in misery
I don't need no doctor

My prescription tells me that

Well, the doctor said I need the rest - ooh, ooh
He put me on the critical list - ooh, ooh
Keeping me safe from harm - ooh, ooh
All I need is her sweet charm - ooh, ooh
He gave me a medical option, that wouldn't do

1996,A Day To Remember,If It Means a Lot to You,sad,"[Verse 1: Jeremy McKinnon]
And hey, darling
I hope you're good tonight
And I know you don't feel right when I'm leaving
Yeah, I want it, but no, I don't need it
Tell me something sweet to get me by
'Cause I can't come back home 'til they're singing

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
La, la la la, la la la, 'til everyone is singing

[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
If you can wait 'til I get home
Then I swear to you that we can make this last, la, la
If you can wait 'til I get home
Then I swear, come tomorrow, this will all be in our past

[Post-Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
Well, it might be for the best
[Verse 2: Sierra Kusterbeck]
And hey, sweetie
Well, I need you here tonight
And I know that you don't want to be leaving me
Yeah, you want it, but I can't help it
I just feel complete when you're by my side
But I know you can't come home 'til they're singing
[Pre-Chorus: Sierra Kusterbeck, Jeremy McKinnon]
La, la la la, la la la, 'til everyone is singing
La, la la la, la la la

Well, it might be for the best

[Bridge: Jeremy McKinnon, Sierra Kusterbeck, Both]
You know you can't give me what I need
And even though you mean so much to me
I can't wait through everything
Is this really happening?
I swear, I'll never be happy again
And don't you dare say we can just be friends
I'm not some boy that you can sway
We knew it'd happen eventually

[Outro: Everyone, Jeremy McKinnon]
La, la la la, la la la, now everybody's singing
La, la la la, la la la, now everybody's singing
(If you can wait 'til I get home)

La, la la la, la la la, now everybody's singing
(Then I swear we can make this last)

1997,Prince,"Beautiful, Loved and Blessed",relaxed,"[Intro: Támar Davis and Prince]
Wake up
You're beautiful, loved and blessed
You feel me?
I think I do

[Verse 1: Támar Davis and Prince]
When you found me I was just a piece of clay
I was formless, you gave me a new name
With the breath of life I now live abundantly
All I needed was the potter's hand
And the blood on Calvary

But too much power
Can sometimes turn to shame
Too much desire
Sometimes makes you feel the same (Come on)
But forgiveness is how you win the game
I begged for truth, now I know the truth
And that is when you came and said I was

[Chorus: Támar Davis & Prince]
Beautiful, loved and blessed
I'm better than the day before
'Cause you made me confess that I am
Beautiful, loved and blessed
When you're free, you're really free indeed
All you gotta do is just plant the seed
[Verse 2: Prince & Támar Davis]
A constant battle to stay ahead of the game
Is anybody famous when everybody wants fame?
Always trying to break you down thinkin' that it'll raise 'em up
I just wanna be happy, come, take this bitter cup from me

If I were to ever write down my life story
I could truly say with all the fame and glory
I was just a piece of clay in need of the potter's hand
'Cause when you whispered in my ear
The words I so now understand, oh

[Chorus: Támar Davis & Prince]
Beautiful, loved and blessed
I'm better than the day before
'Cause you made me confess that I am
Beautiful, loved and blessed
When you're free, you're really free indeed
All you gotta do is just plant the seed

[Bridge: Támar Davis]
Everything you made you said, ""That's good""
Before the fall of man you said, ""That's good""
Every time I walk in faith, that's good
You let me see another day, that's good
Before the Earth was made you said ""Támar
I will lead the way and you'll go far""
Knowledge and understanding
Understanding is good
And when I wake up in the morning
All I hear in my hood is people saying that they're

[Chorus: Támar Davis & Prince]
Beautiful, loved and blessed
Will you rescue me from the darkness?
And now I just must confess
That I am beautiful, loved and blessed
Oh, when you're free you're free indeed
All you gotta do is just plant the seed

[Post-Chorus: Támar Davis]
Hey, hey, hey
Wake up, it's a new day
Hey, hey, hey
Wave your hands in the air and say
Hey, hey, hey
Wake up it's a new day
Hey, hey, hey
Wave your hands in the air and say

[Chorus: Támar Davis & Prince]
Beautiful, loved and blessed
You rescued me from the
Darkness in the wilderness
That's why I am beautiful, loved and blessed
No matter what the challenge
I'll always pass the test
[Outro: Támar Davis & Prince]
That's why I am
That's why I am
That's why I am
I don't mean to put nobody down
Still I must confess that I am
Beautiful, oh
When you wanna give up
Don't 'cause you know
You've always got a friend
That's why I am
That's why I am
That's why I am
Beautiful, beautiful
That's why I am
That's why I am
That's why I am
Beautiful, beautiful
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful
Beautiful, beautifulEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",r&b
1998,Deine Lakaien,The Game,sad,"Grey eyes flicker
Cold is the weed
Worn out shoes
Air full of grief
It is you now
Stuck within
Soul is burning
No chance to win

What have you done to the game
Was it a victory, a shame
Where have you gone
Before morning dew
The game will not end
Without you

Ears of lost minds
Luke and torn
Dresses rotten
And broken stores
And the meaning
It's sold too soon
Can the blister
Substitute the moon

What have you done to the game
Was it a victory, a shame
Where have you gone
Before morning dew
The game will not end
Without you
And the hot sun
Paints the door
Your philanthropist
Sighed once more
Wind was blowing
Air through pipes
Holes in bodies
Mortal crimes

What have you done to the game
Was it a victory, a shame
Where have you gone
Before morning dew
The game will not end
Without youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",new age
1999,Fatboy Slim,Talking Bout My Baby,happy,"Yeah Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Woah yeah talkin' 'bout my baby
Talkin' 'bout my baby
When she goes walkin' down Bourbon street
I just can't hardly stand to walk behind her
Shes got her red hot pants on
She got on her yellow high heeled sneakers
She got on a yellow low neck see through blouse
Without her brassiere on
She's shakin' like two big ol' balloons in a hurricane
Ooooh, she's got on a purple afro wig
She got a hand on her hip
Lettin' her back bone slip
Battin' her eye, battin' her eye
Battin' her eye, battin' her eye
Battin' her eye n' lookin' straight at me
Yeah, lookin' straight at me
She's battin' her eyes and lookin' straight at me
With that sassy, saucy look on her face
Shit son, yeah
I want to go out on a picnic with you, baby
Out under the big bright yellow sun
She said ""I wanna go out on a picnic with you, baby
Out under the big bright yellow sun""
Under the big bright yellow sun
